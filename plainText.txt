slice of intensified historyhistory as i saw it itdoes not pretend to be anything but a detailed account of the novemberrevolution when the bolsheviki at the head of the workers andsoldiers seized the state power of russia and placed it in the handsof the sovietsnaturally most of it deals with red petrograd the capital and heartof the insurrection but the reader must realize that what took placein petrograd was almost exactly duplicated with greater or lesserintensity at different intervals of time all over russiain this book the first of several which i am writing i must confinemyself to a chronicle of those events which i myself observed andexperienced and those supported by reliable evidence preceded by twochapters briefly outlining the background and causes of the novemberrevolution i am aware that these two chapters make difficult readingbut they are essential to an understanding of what followsmany questions will suggest themselves to the mind of the reader whatis bolshevism what kind of a governmental structure did the bolshevikiset up if the bolsheviki championed the constituent assembly beforethe november revolution why did they disperse it by force of armsafterward and if the bourgeoisie opposed the constituent assemblyuntil the danger of bolshevism became apparent why did they championit afterwardthese and many other questions cannot be answered here in anothervolume kornilov to brestlitovsk i trace the course of therevolution up to and including the german peace there i explain theorigin and functions of the revolutionary organisations the evolutionof popular sentiment the dissolution of the constituent assembly thestructure of the soviet state and the course and outcome of the brestlitovsk negotiationsin considering the rise of the bolsheviki it is necessary to understandthat russian economic life and the russian army were not disorganisedon november th but many months before as the logical result ofa process which began as far back as the corrupt reactionaries incontrol of the tsars court deliberately undertook to wreck russia inorder to make a separate peace with germany the lack of arms on thefront which had caused the great retreat of the summer of thelack of food in the army and in the great cities the breakdown ofmanufactures and transportation in all these we know now were partof a gigantic campaign of sabotage this was halted just in time by themarch revolutionfor the first few months of the new rgime in spite of the confusionincident upon a great revolution when one hundred and sixty millionsof the worlds most oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty boththe internal situation and the combative power of the army actuallyimprovedbut the honeymoon was short the propertied classes wanted merely apolitical revolution which would take the power from the tsar and giveit to them they wanted russia to be a constitutional republic likefrance or the united states or a constitutional monarchy likeengland on the other hand the masses of the people wanted realindustrial and agrarian democracywilliam english walling in his book russias message an account ofthe revolution of describes very well the state of mind of therussian workers who were later to support bolshevism almostunanimouslythey the working people saw it was possible that even under a freegovernment if it fell into the hands of other social classes theymight still continue to starvethe russian workman is revolutionary but he is neither violentdogmatic nor unintelligent he is ready for barricades but he hasstudied them and alone of the workers of the world he has learnedabout them from actual experience he is ready and willing to fight hisoppressor the capitalist class to a finish but he does not ignorethe existence of other classes he merely asks that the other classestake one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws nearthey the workers were all agreed that our american politicalinstitutions were preferable to their own but they were not veryanxious to exchange one despot for another ie the capitalistclassthe workingmen of russia did not have themselves shot down executed byhundreds in moscow riga and odessa imprisoned by thousands in everyrussian jail and exiled to the deserts and the arctic regions inexchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of goldfieldsand cripple creekand so developed in russia in the midst of a foreign war the socialrevolution on top of the political revolution culminating in thetriumph of bolshevismmr a j sack director in this country of the russian informationbureau which opposes the soviet government has this to say in hisbook the birth of the russian democracy the bolsheviks organisedtheir own cabinet with nicholas lenine as premier and leon trotskyminister of foreign affairs the inevitability of their coming intopower became evident almost immediately after the march revolution thehistory of the bolsheviki after the revolution is a history of theirsteady growthforeigners and americans especially frequently emphasise theignorance of the russian workers it is true they lacked thepolitical experience of the peoples of the west but they were verywell trained in voluntary organisation in there were more thantwelve million members of the russian consumers cooperative societiesand the soviets themselves are a wonderful demonstration of theirorganising genius moreover there is probably not a people in theworld so well educated in socialist theory and its practicalapplicationwilliam english walling thus characterises themthe russian working people are for the most part able to read andwrite for many years the country has been in such a disturbedcondition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only ofintelligent individuals in their midst but of a large part of theequally revolutionary educated class who have turned to the workingpeople with their ideas for the political and social regeneration ofrussiamany writers explain their hostility to the soviet government byarguing that the last phase of the russian revolution was simply astruggle of the respectable elements against the brutal attacks ofbolshevism however it was the propertied classes who when theyrealised the growth in power of the popular revolutionaryorganisations undertook to destroy them and to halt the revolution tothis end the propertied classes finally resorted to desperate measuresin order to wreck the kerensky ministry and the soviets transportationwas disorganised and internal troubles provoked to crush the factoryshop committees plants were shut down and fuel and raw materialsdiverted to break the army committees at the front capital punishmentwas restored and military defeat connived atthis was all excellent fuel for the bolshevik fire the bolshevikiretorted by preaching the class war and by asserting the supremacy ofthe sovietsbetween these two extremes with the other factions which wholeheartedly or halfheartedly supported them were the socalledmoderate socialists the mensheviki and socialist revolutionariesand several smaller parties these groups were also attacked by thepropertied classes but their power of resistance was crippled by theirtheoriesroughly the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries believed thatrussia was not economically ripe for a social revolutionthat only apolitical revolution was possible according to their interpretationthe russian masses were not educated enough to take over the power anyattempt to do so would inevitably bring on a reaction by means ofwhich some ruthless opportunist might restore the old rgime and so itfollowed that when the moderate socialists were forced to assume thepower they were afraid to use itthey believed that russia must pass through the stages of political andeconomic development known to western europe and emerge at last withthe rest of the world into fullfledged socialism naturallytherefore they agreed with the propertied classes that russia mustfirst be a parliamentary statethough with some improvements on thewestern democracies as a consequence they insisted upon thecollaboration of the propertied classes in the governmentfrom this it was an easy step to supporting them the moderatesocialists needed the bourgeoisie but the bourgeoisie did not need themoderate socialists so it resulted in the socialist ministers beingobliged to give way little by little on their entire program whilethe propertied classes grew more and more insistentand at the end when the bolsheviki upset the whole hollow compromisethe mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries found themselves fightingon the side of the propertied classes in almost every country in theworld today the same phenomenon is visibleinstead of being a destructive force it seems to me that thebolsheviki were the only party in russia with a constructive programand the power to impose it on the country if they had not succeeded tothe government when they did there is little doubt in my mind that thearmies of imperial germany would have been in petrograd and moscow indecember and russia would again be ridden by a tsarit is still fashionable after a whole year of the soviet governmentto speak of the bolshevik insurrection as an adventure adventure itwas and one of the most marvellous mankind ever embarked uponsweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses and stakingeverything on their vast and simple desires already the machinery hadbeen set up by which the land of the great estates could be distributedamong the peasants the factoryshop committees and the trade unionswere there to put into operation workers control of industry in everyvillage town city district and province there were soviets ofworkers soldiers and peasants deputies prepared to assume the taskof local administrationno matter what one thinks of bolshevism it is undeniable that therussian revolution is one of the great events of human history and therise of the bolsheviki a phenomenon of worldwide importance just ashistorians search the records for the minutest details of the story ofthe paris commune so they will want to know what happened in petrogradin november the spirit which animated the people and how theleaders looked talked and acted it is with this in view that i havewritten this bookin the struggle my sympathies were not neutral but in telling thestory of those great days i have tried to see events with the eye of aconscientious reporter interested in setting down the truth j r new york january st notes and explanationsto the average reader the multiplicity of russianorganisationspolitical groups committees and central committeessoviets dumas and unionswill prove extremely confusing for thisreason i am giving here a few brief definitions and explanations political partiesin the elections to the constituent assembly there were seventeentickets in petrograd and in some of the provincial towns as many asforty but the following summary of the aims and composition ofpolitical parties is limited to the groups and factions mentioned inthis book only the essence of their programmes and the generalcharacter of their constituencies can be noticed monarchists of various shades octobrists etc theseoncepowerful factions no longer existed openly they either workedunderground or their members joined the cadets as the cadetscame by degrees to stand for their political programmerepresentatives in this book rodzianko shulgin cadets socalled from the initials of its nameconstitutional democrats its official name is party of the peoplesfreedom under the tsar composed of liberals from the propertiedclasses the cadets were the great party of political reformroughly corresponding to the progressive party in america when therevolution broke out in march the cadets formed the firstprovisional government the cadet ministry was overthrown in aprilbecause it declared itself in favour of allied imperialistic aimsincluding the imperialistic aims of the tsars government as therevolution became more and more a social economic revolution thecadets grew more and more conservative its representatives in thisbook are miliukov vinaver shatsky a group of public men after the cadets had become unpopularthrough their relations with the kornilov counterrevolution thegroup of public men was formed in moscow delegates from the groupof public men were given portfolios in the last kerensky cabinetthe group declared itself nonpartisan although its intellectualleaders were men like rodzianko and shulgin it was composed of themore modern bankers merchants and manufacturers who wereintelligent enough to realise that the soviets must be fought bytheir own weaponeconomic organisation typical of the grouplianozov konovalov populist socialists or trudoviki labour groupnumerically a small party composed of cautious intellectuals theleaders of the cooperative societies and conservative peasantsprofessing to be socialists the populists really supported theinterests of the petty bourgeoisieclerks shopkeepers etc bydirect descent inheritors of the compromising tradition of thelabour group in the fourth imperial duma which was composed largelyof peasant representatives kerensky was the leader of thetrudoviki in the imperial duma when the revolution of march broke out the populist socialists are a nationalistic party theirrepresentatives in this book are peshekhanov tchaikovsky russian social democratic labour party originally marxiansocialists at a party congress held in the party split on thequestion of tactics into two factionsthe majority bolshinstvoand the minority menshinstvo from this sprang the namesbolsheviki and menshevikimembers of the majority and membersof the minority these two wings became two separate parties bothcalling themselves russian social democratic labour party and bothprofessing to be marxians since the revolution of thebolsheviki were really the minority becoming again the majority inseptember a mensheviki this party includes all shades of socialists whobelieve that society must progress by natural evolution towardsocialism and that the workingclass must conquer political powerfirst also a nationalistic party this was the party of thesocialist intellectuals which means all the means of educationhaving been in the hands of the propertied classes the intellectualsinstinctively reacted to their training and took the side of thepropertied classes among their representatives in this book aredan lieber tseretelli b mensheviki internationalists the radical wing of themensheviki internationalists and opposed to all coalition with thepropertied classes yet unwilling to break loose from theconservative mensheviki and opposed to the dictatorship of theworkingclass advocated by the bolsheviki trotzky was long a memberof this group among their leaders martov martinov c bolsheviki now call themselves the communist party inorder to emphasise their complete separation from the tradition ofmoderate or parliamentary socialism which dominates themensheviki and the socalled majority socialists in all countriesthe bolsheviki proposed immediate proletarian insurrection andseizure of the reins of government in order to hasten the coming ofsocialism by forcibly taking over industry land natural resourcesand financial institutions this party expresses the desires chieflyof the factory workers but also of a large section of the poorpeasants the name bolshevik can not be translated bymaximalist the maximalists are a separate group see paragraphb among the leaders lenin trotzky lunatcharsky d united social democrats internationalists also called thenovaya zhizn new life group from the name of the veryinfluential newspaper which was its organ a little group ofintellectuals with a very small following among the workingclassexcept the personal following of maxim gorky its leaderintellectuals with almost the same programme as the menshevikiinternationalists except that the novaya zhizn group refused tobe tied to either of the two great factions opposed the bolsheviktactics but remained in the soviet government other representativesin this book avilov kramarov e yedinstvo a very small and dwindling group composed almostentirely of the personal following of plekhanov one of the pioneersof the russian social democratic movement in the s and itsgreatest theoretician now an old man plekhanov was extremelypatriotic too conservative even for the mensheviki after thebolshevik coup detat yedinstvo disappeared socialist revolutionary party called essaires from theinitials of their name originally the revolutionary party of thepeasants the party of the fighting organisationsthe terroristsafter the march revolution it was joined by many who had never beensocialists at that time it stood for the abolition of privateproperty in land only the owners to be compensated in some fashionfinally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants forced theessaires to abandon the compensation clause and led to theyounger and more fiery intellectuals breaking off from the main partyin the fall of and forming a new party the left socialistrevolutionary party the essaires who were afterward alwayscalled by the radical groups right socialist revolutionariesadopted the political attitude of the mensheviki and worked togetherwith them they finally came to represent the wealthier peasants theintellectuals and the politically uneducated populations of remoterural districts among them there was however a wider difference ofshades of political and economic opinion than among the menshevikiamong their leaders mentioned in these pages avksentiev gotzkerensky tchernov babuschka breshkovskaya a left socialist revolutionaries although theoretically sharingthe bolshevik programme of dictatorship of the workingclass atfirst were reluctant to follow the ruthless bolshevik tacticshowever the left socialist revolutionaries remained in the sovietgovernment sharing the cabinet portfolios especially that ofagriculture they withdrew from the government several times butalways returned as the peasants left the ranks of the essaires inincreasing numbers they joined the left socialist revolutionaryparty which became the great peasant party supporting the sovietgovernment standing for confiscation without compensation of thegreat landed estates and their disposition by the peasantsthemselves among the leaders spiridonova karelin kamkovkalagayev b maximalists an offshoot of the socialist revolutionaryparty in the revolution of when it was a powerful peasantmovement demanding the immediate application of the maximumsocialist programme now an insignificant group of peasantanarchists parliamentary procedurerussian meetings and conventions are organised after the continentalmodel rather than our own the first action is usually the electionof officers and the presidium the presidium is a presiding committee composed ofrepresentatives of the groups and political factions represented inthe assembly in proportion to their numbers the presidiumarranges the order of business and its members can be called upon bythe president to take the chair pro tem each question vopros is stated in a general way and thendebated and at the close of the debate resolutions are submitted bythe different factions and each one voted on separately the orderof business can be and usually is smashed to pieces in the firsthalf hour on the plea of emergency which the crowd almost alwaysgrants anybody from the floor can get up and say anything on anysubject the crowd controls the meeting practically the onlyfunctions of the speaker being to keep order by ringing a littlebell and to recognise speakers almost all the real work of thesession is done in caucuses of the different groups and politicalfactions which almost always cast their votes in a body and arerepresented by floorleaders the result is however that at everyimportant new point or vote the session takes a recess to enablethe different groups and political factions to hold a caucus the crowd is extremely noisy cheering or heckling speakersoverriding the plans of the presidium among the customary criesare prosim please go on pravilno or eto viernothats true right do volno enough doloi down with himposor shame and teesche silence not so noisy popular organisations soviet the word soviet means council under the tsar theimperial council of state was called gosudarstvennyi soviet sincethe revolution however the term soviet has come to be associatedwith a certain type of parliament elected by members of workingclasseconomic organisationsthe soviet of workers of soldiers or ofpeasants deputies i have therefore limited the word to thesebodies and wherever else it occurs i have translated it council besides the local soviets elected in every city town andvillage of russiaand in large cities also ward raionnysovietsthere are also the oblastne or gubiernsky district orprovincial soviets and the central executive committee of theallrussian soviets in the capital called from its initialstsayeekah see below central committees almost everywhere the soviets of workers and of soldiersdeputies combined very soon after the march revolution in specialmatters concerning their peculiar interests however the workersand the soldiers sections continued to meet separately thesoviets of peasants deputies did not join the other two untilafter the bolshevik coup detat they too were organised like theworkers and soldiers with an executive committee of the allrussianpeasants soviets in the capital trade unions although mostly industrial in form the russianlabour unions were still called trade unions and at the time of thebolshevik revolution had from three to four million members theseunions were also organised in an allrussian body a sort of russianfederation of labour which had its central executive committee inthe capital factoryshop committees these were spontaneous organisationscreated in the factories by the workers in their attempt to controlindustry taking advantage of the administrative breakdown incidentupon the revolution their function was by revolutionary action totake over and run the factories the factoryshop committees alsohad their allrussian organisation with a central committee atpetrograd which cooperated with the trade unions dumas the word duma means roughly deliberative body theold imperial duma which persisted six months after the revolutionin a democratised form died a natural death in september thecity duma referred to in this book was the reorganised municipalcouncil often called municipal selfgovernment it was elected bydirect and secret ballot and its only reason for failure to hold themasses during the bolshevik revolution was the general decline ininfluence of all purely political representation in the fact of thegrowing power of organisations based on economic groups zemstvos may be roughly translated county councils underthe tsar semipolitical semisocial bodies with very littleadministrative power developed and controlled largely byintellectual liberals among the landowning classes their mostimportant function was education and social service among thepeasants during the war the zemstvos gradually took over theentire feeding and clothing of the russian army as well as thebuying from foreign countries and work among the soldiers generallycorresponding to the work of the american y m c a at the frontafter the march revolution the zemstvos were democratized with aview to making them the organs of local government in the ruraldistricts but like the city dumas they could not compete with thesoviets cooperatives these were the workers and peasants consumerscooperative societies which had several million members all overrussia before the revolution founded by liberals and moderatesocialists the cooperative movement was not supported by therevolutionary socialist groups because it was a substitute for thecomplete transference of means of production and distribution intothe hands of the workers after the march revolution thecooperatives spread rapidly and were dominated by populistsocialists mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries and acted as aconservative political force until the bolshevik revolution howeverit was the cooperatives which fed russia when the old structure ofcommerce and transportation collapsed army committees the army committees were formed by thesoldiers at the front to combat the reactionary influence of the oldregime officers every company regiment brigade division and corpshad its committee over all of which was elected the armycommittee the central army committee cooperated with the generalstaff the administrative breakdown in the army incident upon therevolution threw upon the shoulders of the army committees most ofthe work of the quartermasters department and in some cases eventhe command of troops fleet committees the corresponding organisations in the navy central committeesin the spring and summer of allrussian conventions of everysort of organisation were held at petrograd there were nationalcongresses of workers soldiers and peasants soviets tradeunions factoryshop committees army and fleet committeesbesidesevery branch of the military and naval service cooperativesnationalities etc each of these conventions elected a centralcommittee or a central executive committee to guard its particularinterests at the seat of government as the provisional governmentgrew weaker these central committees were forced to assume more andmore administrative powers the most important central committees mentioned in this book are union of unions during the revolution of professormiliukov and other liberals established unions of professionalmendoctors lawyers physicians etc these were united under onecentral organisation the union of unions in the union ofunions acted with the revolutionary democracy in however theunion of unions opposed the bolshevik uprising and united thegovernment employees who went on strike against the authority of thesoviets tsayeekah allrussian

and sprang intoexistence again in the days of march when a force was neededto keep order in the city at that time they were armed and allefforts of the provisional government to disarm them were more

emerged in the laststages of the revolution to defend private property from thebolshevik attempt to abolish it a great many of them were universitystudents tekhintsi the socalled savage division in the army made upof mohametan tribesmen from central asia and personally devoted togeneral kornilov the tekhintsi were noted for their blindobedience and their savage cruelty in warfare death battalions or shock battalions the womens battalion isknown to the world as the death battalion but there were manydeath battalions composed of men these were formed in the summerof by kerensky for

earlier in the spelling of russian names and words i have made no attemptto follow any scientific rules for transliteration but have tried togive the spelling which would lead the englishspeaking reader to thesimplest approximation of their pronunciation sourcesmuch of the material in this book is from my own notes i have alsorelied however upon a heterogeneous file of several hundredassorted russian newspapers covering almost every day of the timedescribed of files of the english paper the russian daily newsand of the two french papers journal de russie and entente butfar more valuable than these is the bulletin de la presse issueddaily by the french information bureau in petrograd which reportsall important happenings speeches and the comment of the russianpress of this i have an almost complete file from the spring of to the end of january besides the foregoing i have in my possession almost everyproclamation decree and announcement posted on the walls ofpetrograd from the middle of september to the end of january also the official publication of all government decrees andorders and the official government publication of the secrettreaties and other documents discovered in the ministry of foreignaffairs when the bolsheviki took it over ten days that shook the world chapter i backgroundtoward the end of september an alien professor of sociologyvisiting russia came to see me in petrograd he had been informed bybusiness men and intellectuals that the revolution was slowing downthe professor wrote an article about it and then travelled aroundthe country visiting factory towns and peasant communitieswhere tohis astonishment the revolution seemed to be speeding up among thewageearners and the landworking people it was common to hear talkof all land to the peasants all factories to the workers if theprofessor had visited the front he would have heard the whole armytalking peacethe professor was puzzled but he need not have been bothobservations were correct the propertyowning classes were becomingmore conservative the masses of the people more radicalthere was a feeling among business men and the intelligentziagenerally that the revolution had gone quite far enough and lastedtoo long that things should settle down this sentiment was sharedby the dominant moderate socialist groups the oborontsi seeapp i sect mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries whosupported the provisional government of kerenskyon october th the official organ of the moderate socialists saidthe drama of revolution has two acts the destruction of the oldrgime and the creation of the new one the first act has lasted longenough now it is time to go on to the second and to play it asrapidly as possible as a great revolutionist put it let us hastenfriends to terminate the revolution he who makes it last too longwill not gather the fruitsamong the worker soldier and peasant masses however there was astubborn feeling that the first act was not yet played out on thefront the army committees were always running foul of officers whocould not get used to treating their men like human beings in therear the land committees elected by the peasants were being jailedfor trying to carry out government regulations concerning the landand the workmen see app i sect in the factories were fightingblacklists and lockouts nay furthermore returning politicalexiles

blackmail onbehalf of the bourgeoisiethe direct result of all this was the rise of the bolshevikisince march when the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiersbeating upon the tauride palace compelled the reluctant imperial dumato assume the supreme power in russia it was the masses of thepeople workers soldiers and peasants which forced every change inthe course of the revolution they hurled the miliukov ministry downit was their soviet which proclaimed to the world the russian peacetermsno annexations no indemnities and the right ofselfdetermination of peoples and again in july it was thespontaneous rising of the unorganised proletariat which once morestormed the tauride palace to demand that the soviets take over thegovernment of russiathe bolsheviki then a small political sect put themselves at thehead of the movement as a result of the disastrous failure of therising public opinion turned against them and their leaderlesshordes slunk back into the viborg quarter which is

thebolshevik papers were suppressed provocators and reactionariesraised the cry that the bolsheviki were german agents until peopleall over the world believed itbut the provisional government found itself unable to substantiateits accusations the documents proving progerman conspiracy werediscovered to be forgeries and one by one the bolsheviki werepart of the famous sisson documentsreleased from prison without trial on nominal or no bailuntil onlysix remained the impotence and indecision of the everchangingprovisional government was an argument nobody could refute thebolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the masses all powerto the sovietsand they were not merely selfseeking for at thattime the majority of the soviets was moderate socialist theirbitter enemybut more potent still they took the crude simple desires of theworkers soldiers and peasants and from them built their immediateprogramme and so while the oborontsi mensheviki and socialistrevolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with thebourgeoisie the bolsheviki rapidly captured the russian masses injuly they were hunted and despised by september the metropolitanworkmen the sailors of the baltic fleet and the soldiers had beenwon almost entirely to their cause the september municipal electionsin the large cities see app i sect were significant only per cent of the returns were menshevik and socialist revolutionaryagainst more than per cent in junethere remains a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers the factthat the central executive committees of the soviets the centralarmy and fleet committees and the central committees of some ofsee notes and explanationsthe unionsnotably the post and telegraph workers and the railwayworkersopposed the bolsheviki with the utmost violence thesecentral committees had all been elected in the middle of the summeror even before when the mensheviki and socialist revolutionaries hadan enormous following and they delayed or prevented any newelections thus according to the constitution of the soviets ofworkers and soldiers deputies the allrussian congress shouldhave been called in september but the tsayeekah would notsee notes and explanationscall the meeting on the ground that the constituent assembly wasonly two months away at which time they hinted the soviets wouldabdicate meanwhile one by one the bolsheviki were winning in thelocal soviets all over the country in the union branches and theranks of the soldiers and sailors the peasants soviets remainedstill conservative because in the sluggish rural districts politicalconsciousness developed slowly and the socialist revolutionary partyhad been for a generation the party which had agitated among thepeasants but even among the peasants a revolutionary wing wasforming it showed itself clearly in october when the left wing ofthe socialist revolutionaries split off and formed a new politicalfaction the left socialist revolutionariesat the same time there

russian rockefelleracadet by political faithrevolution he said is a sickness sooner or later the foreignpowers must intervene hereas one would intervene to cure a sickchild and teach it how to walk of course it would be more or lessimproper but the nations must realise the danger of bolshevism intheir own countriessuch contagious ideas as proletariandictatorship and world social revolution there is a chance thatthis intervention may not be necessary transportation isdemoralised the factories are closing down and the germans areadvancing starvation and defeat may bring the russian people totheir sensesmr lianozov was emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened itwould be impossible for merchants and manufacturers to permit theexistence of the workers shop committees or to allow the workersany share in the management of industryas for the bolsheviki they will be done away with by one of twomethods the government can evacuate petrograd then a state of siegedeclared and the military commander of the district can deal withthese gentlemen without legal formalities or if for example theconstituent assembly manifests any utopian tendencies it can bedispersed by force of

flooded by their owners of textile factories atmoscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they leftof railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of cripplinglocomotivesa large section of the propertied classes preferred the germans tothe revolutioneven to the provisional governmentand didnt hesitateto say so in the russian household where i lived the subject ofconversation at the dinner table was almost invariably the coming ofthe germans bringing law and order one evening i spent at thehouse of a moscow merchant during tea we asked the eleven people atthe table whether

give herethe provisional government is absolutely powerless the bourgeoisieis in control but this control is masked by a fictitious coalitionwith the oborontsi parties now during the revolution one seesrevolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for their promised landand all over the country in all the toiling classes the samedisgust is evident this domination by the bourgeoisie is onlypossible by means of civil war the kornilov method is the only wayby which the bourgeoisie can control but it is force which thebourgeoisie lacks the army is with us the conciliators andpacifists socialist revolutionaries and mensheviki have lost allauthoritybecause the struggle between the peasants and thelandlords between the workers and the employers between thesoldiers and the officers has become more bitter moreirreconcilable than ever only by the concerted action of the popularmass only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship can therevolution be achieved and the people savedthe soviets are the most perfect representatives of thepeopleperfect in their revolutionary experience in their ideas andobjects based directly upon the army in the trenches the workers inthe factories and the peasants in the fields they are the backboneof the revolutionthere has been an attempt to create a power without the sovietsandonly powerlessness has been created counterrevolutionary schemes ofall sorts are now being hatched in the corridors of the council ofthe russian republic the cadet party represents thecounterrevolution militant on the other side the soviets representthe cause of the people between the two camps there are no groups ofserious importance it is the lutte finale the bourgeoiscounterrevolution organises all its forces and waits for the momentto attack us our answer will be decisive we will complete the workscarcely begun in march and advanced during the kornilov affairhe went on to speak of the new governments foreign policyour first act will be to call for an immediate armistice on allfronts and a conference of peoples to discuss democratic peaceterms the quantity of democracy we get in the peace settlementdepends on the quantity of revolutionary response there is in europeif we create here a government of the soviets that will be apowerful factor for immediate peace in europe for this governmentwill address itself directly and immediately to all peoples over theheads of their governments proposing an armistice at the moment ofthe conclusion of peace the pressure of the russian revolution willbe in the direction of no annexations no indemnities the right ofselfdetermination of peoples and a federated republic of europeat the end of this war i see europe recreated not by the diplomatsbut by the proletariat the federated republic of europethe unitedstates of europethat is what must be national autonomy no longersuffices economic evolution demands the abolition of nationalfrontiers if europe is to remain split into national groups thenimperialism will recommence its work only a federated republic ofeurope can give peace to the world he smiledthat fine faintlyironical smile of his but without the action of the europeanmasses these ends cannot be realisednownow while everybody was waiting for the bolsheviki to appear suddenlyon the streets one morning and begin to shoot down people with whitecollars on the real insurrection took its way quite naturally andopenlythe provisional government planned to send the petrograd garrison tothe frontthe petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men who hadtaken a prominent part in the revolution it was they who had turnedthe tide in the great days of march created the soviets of soldiersdeputies and hurled back kornilov from the gates of petrogradnow a large part of them were bolsheviki when the provisionalgovernment talked of evacuating the city it was the petrogradgarrison which answered if you are not capable of defending thecapital conclude peace if you cannot conclude peace go away andmake room for a peoples government which can do bothit was evident that any attempt at insurrection depended upon theattitude of the petrograd garrison the governments plan was toreplace the garrison regiments with dependable troopscossacksdeath battalions the army committees the moderate socialists andthe tsayeekah supported the government a widespread agitationwas carried on at the front and in petrograd emphasizing the factthat for eight months the petrograd garrison had been leading an easylife in the barracks of the capital while their exhausted comradesin the trenches starved and diednaturally there was some truth in the accusation that the garrisonregiments were reluctant to exchange their comparative comfort forthe hardships of a winter campaign but there were other reasons whythey refused to go the petrograd soviet feared the governmentsintentions and from the front came hundreds of delegates chosen bythe common soldiers crying it is true we need reinforcements butmore important we must know that petrograd and the revolution arewellguarded do you hold the rear comrades and we will hold thefronton october th behind closed doors the central committee of thepetrograd soviet discussed the formation of a special militarycommittee to decide the whole question the next day a meeting of thesoldiers

into thegreat hall trotzky was just finishingwe are asked he said if we intend to have a vystuplennie ican give a clear answer to that question the petrograd soviet feelsthat at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall into thehands of the soviets this transfer of government will beaccomplished by the allrussian congress whether an armeddemonstration is necessary will depend on those who wish tointerfere with the allrussian congresswe feel that our government entrusted to the personnel of theprovisional cabinet is a pitiful and helpless government which onlyawaits the sweep of the broom of history to give way to a reallypopular government but we are trying to avoid a conflict even nowtoday we hope that the allrussian congress will take into itshands that power and authority which rests upon the organised freedomof the people if however the government wants to utilise the shortperiod it is expected to livetwentyfour forty eight orseventytwo hoursto attack us then we shall answer withcounterattacks blow for blow steel for ironamid cheers he announced that the left socialist revolutionaries hadagreed to send representatives into the military revolutionarycommitteeas i left smolny at three oclock in the morning i noticed that tworapidfiring guns had been mounted one on each side of the door andthat strong patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the nearbystreetcorners bill shatov came bounding up the steps well he well known in the american labor movementcried were off kerensky sent the yunkers to close down ourpapers soldat and rabotchi put but our troops went down andsmashed the government seals and now were sending detachments toseize the bourgeois newspaper offices exultantly he slapped me onthe shoulder and ran inon the morning of the th i had business with the censor whoseoffice was in the ministry of foreign affairs everywhere on all thewalls hysterical appeals to the people to remain calm polkovnikovemitted prikaz after prikazi order all military units and detachments to remain in theirbarracks until further orders from the staff of the militarydistrict all officers who act without orders from their superiorswill be

zhivoye slovo rabotchi put and soldat anddecreed the arrest of the leaders of the petrograd soviet and themembers of the military revolutionary committeeas i crossed the palace square several batteries of yunkerartillery came through the red arch at a jingling trot and drew upbefore the palace the great red building of the general staff wasunusually animated several armoured automobiles ranked before thedoor and motors full of officers were coming and going the censorwas very much excited like a small boy at a circus kerensky hesaid had just gone to the council of the republic to offer hisresignation i hurried down to the marinsky palace arriving at theend of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of kerenskysfull of selfjustification and bitter denunciation of his enemiesi will cite here the most characteristic passage from a whole seriesof articles published in rabotchi put by ulianovlenin a statecriminal who is in hiding and whom we are trying to find this statecriminal has invited the proletariat and the petrograd garrison torepeat the experience of the thth of july and insists upon theimmediate necessity for an armed rising moreover other bolshevikleaders have taken the floor in a series of meetings and also madean appeal to immediate insurrection particularly should be noticedthe activity of the present president of the petrograd sovietbronsteintrotzkyi ought to bring to your notice that the expressions and the styleof a whole series of articles in rabotchi put and soldat resembleabsolutely those of novaya rus we have to do not so much with themovement of such and such political party as with the exploitationof the political ignorance and criminal instincts of a part of thepopulation a sort of organisation whose object it is to provoke inrussia cost what it may an inconscient movement of destruction andpillage for given the state of mind of the masses any movement atpetrograd will be followed by the most terrible massacres which willcover with eternal shame the name of free russia by the admission of ulianovlenin himself the situation of theextreme left wing of the social democrats in russia is veryfavourable here kerensky read the following quotation from leninsarticlethink of it the german comrades have only one liebknecht withoutnewspapers without freedom of meeting without a soviet they areopposed by the incredible hostility of all classes of societyand yetthe german comrades try to act while we having dozens ofnewspapers freedom of meeting the majority of the soviets we thebestplaced international proletarians of the entire world can werefuse to support the german revolutionists and insurrectionaryorganisationskerensky then continuedthe organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly that the mostperfect conditions for the free action of a political party obtainnow in russia administered by a provisional government at the headof which is in the eyes of this party a usurper and a man who hassold himself to the bourgeoisie the ministerpresident kerensky the organisers of the insurrection do not come to the aid of thegerman proletariat but of the german governing classes and theyopen the russian front to the iron fists of wilhelm and his friendslittle matter to the provisional government the motives of thesepeople little matter if they act consciously or unconsciously butin any case from this tribune in full consciousness of myresponsibility i quality such acts of a russian political party asacts of treason to russia i place myself at the point of view of the right and i proposeimmediately to proceed to an investigation and make the necessaryarrests uproar from the left listen to me he cried in apowerful voice at the moment when the state is in danger becauseof conscious or unconscious treason the provisional government andmyself among others prefer to be killed rather than betray the lifethe honour and the independence of russiaat this moment a paper was handed to kerenskyi have just received the proclamation which they are distributing tothe regiments here is the contents reading the petrogradsoviet of workers and soldiers deputies is menaced we orderimmediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to awaitnew orders all delay or nonexecution of this order will beconsidered as an act of treason to the revolution the militaryrevolutionary committee for the president podvoisky the secretaryantonovin reality this is an attempt to raise the populace against theexisting order of things to break the constituent and to open thefront to the regiments of the iron fist of wilhelmi say populace intentionally because the conscious democracy andits tsayeekah all the army organisations all that free russiaglorifies the good sense the honour and the conscience of the greatrussian democracy protests against these thingsi have not come here with a prayer but to state my firm convictionthat the provisional government which defends at this moment our newlibertythat the new russian state destined to a brilliant futurewill find unanimous support except among those who have never daredto face the truth the provisional government has never violated the liberty of allcitizens of the state to use their political rights but now theprovisional government declares in this moment those elements ofthe russian nation those groups and parties who have dared to lifttheir hands against the free will of the russian people at the sametime threatening to open the front to germany must be liquidatedwith decisionlet the population of petrograd understand that it will encounter afirm power and perhaps at the last moment good sense conscience andhonour will triumph in the hearts of those who still possess themall through this speech the hall rang with deafening clamour whenthe ministerpresident had stepped down palefaced and wet withperspiration and strode out with his suite of officers speakerafter speaker from the left and centre attacked the right all oneangry roaring even the socialist revolutionaries through gotzthe policy of the bolsheviki is demagogic and criminal in theirexploitation of the popular discontent but there is a whole seriesof popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to nowthe questions of peace land and the democratization of the armyought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier peasant orworker would have the least doubt that our government is attemptingfirmly and infallibly to solve themwe mensheviki do not wish to provoke a cabinet crisis and we areready to defend the provisional government with all our energy tothe last drop of our bloodif only the provisional government on allthese burning questions will speak the clear and precise wordsawaited by the people with such impatiencethen martov furiousthe words of the ministerpresident who allowed himself to speak ofpopulace when it is question of the movement of important sectionsof the proletariat and the armyalthough led in the wrongdirectionare nothing but an incitement to civil warthe order of the day proposed by the left was voted it amountedpractically to a vote of lack of confidence the armed demonstration which has been preparing for some dayspast has for its object a coup detat threatens to provoke civilwar creates conditions favourable to pogroms andcounterrevolution the mobilization of counterrevolutionary forcessuch as the black hundreds which will inevitably bring about theimpossibility of convoking the constituent will cause a militarycatastrophe the death of the revolution paralyse the economic lifeof the country and destroy russia the conditions favourable to this agitation have been created bydelay in passing urgent measures as well as objective conditionscaused by the war and the general disorder it is necessary beforeeverything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting the land tothe peasants land committees and to adopt an energetic course ofaction abroad in proposing to the allies to proclaim their peaceterms and to begin peaceparleys to cope with monarchist manifestations and pogromist movementsit is indispensable to take immediate measures to suppress thesemovements and for this purpose to create at petrograd a committee ofpublic safety composed of representatives of the municipality andthe organs of the revolutionary democracy acting in contact with theprovisional governmentit is interesting to note that the mensheviki and socialistrevolutionaries all rallied to this resolution when kerensky sawit however he summoned avksentiev to the winter palace to explainif it expressed a lack of confidence in the provisional governmenthe begged avksentiev to form a new cabinet dan gotz and avksentievthe leaders of the compromisers performed their last compromisethey explained to kerensky that it was not meant as a criticism ofthe governmentat the corner of the morskaya and the nevsky

quieterand more deserted were the streets the city duma was all brightlylighted beyond that we made out a dark mass of people and a lineof sailors who yelled furiously at us to stop the machine sloweddown and we climbed outit was an astonishing scene just at the corner of the ekaterinacanal under an arclight a cordon of armed sailors was drawnacross the nevsky blocking the way to a crowd of people in columnof fours there were about three or four hundred of them men infrock coats welldressed women officersall sorts and conditionsof people among them we recognised many of the delegates

discovered letus return to the duma and discuss the best means of saving thecountry and the revolutionwhereupon in dignified silence the procession marched around andback up the nevsky always in column of fours and taking advantageof the diversion we slipped past the guards and set off in thedirection of the winter palacehere it was absolutely dark and nothing moved but pickets ofsoldiers and red guards grimly intent in front of the kazancathedral a threeinch fieldgun lay in the middle of the streetslewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over the roofssoldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones andpeering down toward the police bridge i heard one voice saying itis possible that we have done wrong at the corners patrolsstopped all passersbyand the composition of these patrols wasinteresting for in command of the regular troops was invariably ared guard the shooting had ceasedjust as we came to the morskaya somebody was shouting theyunkers have sent word they want us to go and get them outvoices began to give commands and in the thick gloom we made out adark mass moving forward silent but for the shuffle of feet and theclinking of arms we fell in with the first rankslike a black river filling all the street without song or cheer wepoured through the red arch where the man just ahead of me said ina low voice look out comrades dont trust them they will firesurely in the open we began to run stooping low and bunchingtogether and jammed up suddenly behind the pedestal of thealexander columnhow many of you did they kill i askedi dont know about tenafter a few minutes huddling there some hundreds of men the armyseemed reassured and without any orders suddenly began again to flowforward by this time in the light that streamed out of all thewinter palace windows i could see that the first two or threehundred men were red guards with only a few scattered soldiersover the barricade of firewood we clambered and leaping down insidegave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of rifles throwndown by the yunkers who had stood there on both sides of the maingateway the doors stood wide open light streamed out and from thehuge pile came not the slightest soundcarried along by the eager wave of men we were swept into the righthand entrance opening into a great bare vaulted room the cellar ofthe east wing from which issued a maze of corridors andstaircases a number of huge packing cases stood about and uponthese the red guards and soldiers fell furiously battering themopen with the butts of their rifles and pulling out carpetscurtains linen porcelain plates glassware one man wentstrutting around with a bronze clock perched on his shoulderanother found a plume of ostrich feathers which he stuck in hishat

insurrectionists crowded to see but there were onlya few angry mutterings it was only later that we learned how thepeople in the street wanted to lynch them and shots were firedbutthe sailors brought them safely to peterpaulin the meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the palace there wasstill a great deal of coming and going of exploring newfoundapartments in the vast edifice of searching for hidden garrisons ofyunkers which did not exist we went upstairs and wandered throughroom after room this part of the palace had been entered also byother detachments from the side of the neva the paintings statuestapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were unharmed inthe offices however every desk and cabinet had been ransacked thepapers scattered over the floor and in the living rooms beds hadbeen stripped of their coverings and wardrobes wrenched open themost highly prized loot was clothing which the working peopleneeded in a room where furniture was stored we came upon twosoldiers ripping the elaborate spanish leather upholstery fromchairs they explained it was to make boots withthe old palace servants in their blue and red and gold uniformsstood nervously about from force of habit repeating you cant goin there barin it is forbidden we penetrated at length to thegold and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where theministers had been in session all that day and night and where theshveitzari had betrayed them to the red guards the long tablecovered with green baize was just as they had left it under arrestbefore each empty seat was pen and ink and paper the papers werescribbled over with beginnings of plans of action rough drafts ofproclamations and manifestos most of these were scratched out astheir futility became evident and the rest of the sheet coveredwith absentminded geometrical designs as the writers satdespondently listening while minister after minister proposedchimerical schemes i took one of these scribbled pages in the handwriting of konovalov which read the provisional governmentappeals to all classes to support the provisional governmentall this time it must be remembered although the winter palace wassurrounded the government was in constant communication with thefront and with provincial russia the bolsheviki had captured theministry of war early in the morning but they did not know of themilitary telegraph office in the attic nor of the private telephoneline connecting it with the winter palace in that attic a youngofficer sat all day pouring out over the country a flood of appealsand proclamations and when he heard that the palace had fallen puton his hat and walked calmly out of the buildinginterested as we were for a considerable time we didnt notice achange in the attitude of the soldiers and red guards around us aswe strolled from room to room a small group followed us until bythe time we reached the great picturegallery where we had spent theafternoon with the yunkers about a hundred men surged in

officersoh because they wore german uniformsthere were hundreds of such absurd tales and they were not onlysolemnly published by the antibolshevik press but believed by themost unlikely personssocialist revolutionaries and mensheviki whohad always been distinguished by their sober devotion to factsbut more serious were the stories of bolshevik violence andterrorism for example it was said printed that the red guards hadnot only thoroughly looted the winter palace but that they hadmassacred the yunkers after disarming them had killed some of theministers in cold blood and as for the woman soldiers most of themhad been violated and many had committed suicide because of thetortures they had gone through all these stories were swallowedwhole by the crowd in the duma and worse still the mothers andfathers of the students and of the women read these frightfuldetails often accompanied by lists of names and toward nightfallthe duma began to be besieged by frantic citizensa typical case is that of prince tumanov whose body it wasannounced in many newspapers had been found floating in the moikacanal a few hours later this was denied by the princes family whoadded that the

thesepourparlers the government appoints its authorised representativesin the neutral countriesthe government proposes to all the governments and to the peoples ofall the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate armistice atthe same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last threemonths during which time it is perfectly possible not only to holdthe necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all thenations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war orforced to take part in it but also to convoke authorised assembliesof representatives of the people of all countries for the purposeof the definite acceptance of the conditions of peacein addressing this offer of peace to the governments and to thepeoples of all the belligerent countries the provisional workersand peasants government of russia addresses equally and inparticular the conscious workers of the three nations most devotedto humanity and the three most important nations among those takingpart in the present warengland france and germany the workers ofthese countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause ofprogress and of socialism the splendid examples of the chartistmovement in england the series of revolutions of worldwidehistorical significance accomplished by the french proletariatandfinally in germany the historic struggle against the laws ofexception an example for the workers of the whole world ofprolonged and stubborn action and the creation of the formidableorganisations of german proletariansall these models of proletarianheroism these monuments of history are for us a sure guaranteethat the workers of these countries will understand the duty imposedupon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences ofwar and that these workers by decisive energetic and continuedaction will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the causeof peaceand at the same time the cause of the liberation of theexploited working masses from all slavery and all exploitationwhen the grave thunder of applause had died away lenin spoke againwe propose to the congress to ratify this declaration we addressourselves to the governments as well as to the peoples for adeclaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of thebelligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace theconditions of peace drawn up during the armistice will be ratifiedby the constituent assembly in fixing the duration of the armisticeat three months we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest aspossible after this bloody extermination and ample time for them toelect their representatives this proposal of peace will meet withresistance on the part of the imperialist governmentswe dont foolourselves on that score but we hope that revolution will soon breakout in all the belligerent countries that is why we addressourselves especially to the workers of france england and germanythe revolution of november th and th he ended has opened theera of the social revolution the labour movement in the name ofpeace and socialism shall win and fulfil its destinythere was something quiet and powerful in all this which stirredthe souls of men it was understandable why people believed whenlenin spokeby crowd vote it was quickly decided that only representatives ofpolitical factions should be allowed to speak on the motion and thatspeakers should be limited to fifteen minutesfirst karelin for the left socialist revolutionaries our factionhad no opportunity to propose amendments to the text of theproclamation it

democrat internationalists and the remnant of themensheviki internationalists avilov with his young intelligentface looking out of place in his smart frockcoatwe must ask ourselves where we are going the ease with which thecoalition government was upset cannot be explained by the strengthof the left wing of the democracy but only by the incapacity of thegovernment to give the people peace and bread and the left wingcannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these questionscan it give bread to the people grain is scarce the majority ofthe peasants will not be with you for you cannot give them themachinery they need fuel and other primary necessities are almostimpossible to procureas for peace that will be even more difficult the allies refusedto talk with skobeliev they

quickest possibleattainment of peace the transfer of the land into the hands of theagrarian committees the organisation of control over industrialproduction and the convocation of the constituent

clappingkarelin followed himalso young fearless whose sincerity no onedoubtedfor the left socialist revolutionaries the party of mariaspiridonova the party which almost alone followed the bolshevikiand which represented the revolutionary peasantsour party has refused to enter the council of peoples commissarsbecause we do not wish forever to separate ourselves from the partof the revolutionary army which left the congress a separationwhich would make it impossible for us to serve as intermediariesbetween the bolsheviki and the other groups of the democracy andthat is our principal duty at this moment we cannot sustain anygovernment except a government of socialist coalitionwe protest moreover against the tyrannical conduct of thebolsheviki our commissars have been driven from their posts ouronly organ znamia truda banner of labour was forbidden toappear yesterdaythe central duma is forming a powerful committee for salvation ofcountry and revolution to fight you already you are isolated andyour government is without the support of a single other democraticgroupand now trotzky stood upon the raised tribune confident anddominating with that sarcastic expression about his mouth which wasalmost a sneer he spoke in a ringing voice and the great crowdrose to himthese considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party arenot new on the eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was alsopredicted everybody was against us only a faction of the socialistrevolutionaries of the left was with us in the militaryrevolutionary committee how is it that we were able to overturn thegovernment almost without bloodshed that fact is the moststriking proof that we were not isolated in reality theprovisional government was isolated the democratic parties whichmarch against us were isolated are isolated and forever cut offfrom the proletariatthey speak of the necessity for a coalition there is only onecoalition possiblethe coalition of the workers soldiers andpoorest peasants and it is our partys honour to have realised thatcoalition what sort of coalition did avilov mean a coalition withthose who supported the government of treason to the peoplecoalition doesnt always add to strength for example could we haveorganised the insurrection with dan and avksentiev in our ranksroars of laughteravksentiev gave little bread will a coalition with the oborontsifurnish more between the peasants and avksentiev who ordered thearrest of the land committees we choose the peasants ourrevolution will remain the classic revolution of historythey accuse us of repelling an agreement with the other democraticparties but is it we who are to blame or must we as karelin putit blame it on a misunderstanding no comrades when a party infull tide of revolution still wreathed in powdersmoke comes tosay here is the powertake itand when those to whom it isoffered go over to the enemy that is not a misunderstanding thatis a declaration of pitiless war and it isnt we who have declaredwaravilov menaces us with failure of our peace effortsif we remainisolated i repeat i dont see how a coalition with skobeliev oreven terestchenko can help us to get peace avilov tries tofrighten us by the threat of a peace at our expense and i answerthat in any case if europe continues to be ruled by the imperialistbourgeoisie revolutionary russia will inevitably be lostthere are only two alternatives either the russian revolution willcreate a revolutionary movement in europe or the european powerswill destroy the russian revolutionthey greeted him with an immense crusading acclaim kindling to thedaring of it with the thought of championing mankind and from thatmoment there was something conscious and decided about theinsurrectionary masses in all their actions which never left thembut on the other side too battle was taking form kamenievrecognised a delegate from the union of railway workers ahardfaced stocky man with an attitude of implacable

government we will followpeace we at the front cannot fight any longer we cannot fighteither germans or russians with that he leaped down and a sort ofconfused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass whichburst into something like anger when the next speaker a menshevikoboronetz tried to say that the war must go on until the allieswere victoriousyou talk like kerensky shouted a rough voicea duma delegate pleading for neutrality him they listened tomuttering uneasily feeling him not one of them never have i seenmen trying so hard to understand to decide they never moved stoodstaring with a sort of terrible intentness at the speaker theirbrows wrinkled with the effort of thought sweat standing out ontheir foreheads great giants of men with the innocent clear eyes ofchildren and the faces of epic warriorsnow a bolshevik was speaking one of their own men violently fullof hate they liked him no more than the other it was not theirmood for the moment they were

not in he was escorting acommission of sabotazhniki sabotageurs from the city duma whoinsisted that the yunkers were all being murdered this seemed toamuse them very much at one side of the room sat a baldheadeddissipatedlooking little man in a frockcoat and a rich fur coatbiting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat hehad just been arrested somebody said glancing carelessly at himthat he was a minister or something the little man didnt seem tohear it he was evidently terrified although the occupants of theroom showed no animosity whatever toward himi went across and spoke to him in french count tolstoy heanswered bowing stiffly i do not understand why i was arrested iwas crossing the troitsky bridge on my way home when two of theseofthesepersons held me up i was a

started the polk regiment was on duty at thegeneral staff the night of the th some of my comrades and i werestanding guard ivan pavlovitch and another mani dont remember hisnamewell they hid behind the windowcurtains in the room where thestaff was having a meeting and they heard a great many things for any things for example they heard orders to bring the gatchina yunkers topetrograd by night and an order for the cossacks to be ready tomarch in the morning the principal points in the city were to beoccupied before dawn then there was the business of opening thebridges but when they began to talk about surrounding smolny thenivan pavlovitch couldnt stand it any longer that minute there wasa good deal of coming and going so he slipped out and came down tothe guardroomleaving the other comrade to pick up what he couldi was already suspicious that something was going on automobilesfull of officers kept coming and all the ministers were there ivanpavlovitch told me what he had heard it was halfpast two in themorning the secretary of the regimental committee was there so wetold him and asked what to doarrest everybody coming and going he says so we began to doit in an hour we had some officers and a couple of ministers whomwe sent up to smolny right away but the military revolutionarycommittee wasnt ready they didnt know what to do and pretty soonback came the order to let everybody go and not arrest anybody elsewell we ran all the way to smolny and i guess we talked for anhour before they finally saw that it was war it was five oclockwhen we got back to the staff and by that time most of them weregone but we got a few and the garrison was all on the marcha red guard from vasili ostrov described in great detail what hadhappened in his district on the great day of the rising we didnthave any machineguns over there he said laughing and wecouldnt get any from smolny comrade zalking who was a member ofthe uprava central bureau of the ward duma remembered all atonce that there was lying in the meetingroom of the uprava amachinegun which had been captured from the germans so he and i andanother comrade went there the mensheviki and socialistrevolutionaries were having a meeting well we opened the door andwalked right in on them as they sat around the tabletwelve orfifteen of them three of us when they saw us they stopped talkingand just stared we walked right across the room uncoupled themachinegun comrade zalkind picked up one part i the other we putthem on our shoulders and walked outand not a single man said aworddo you know how the winter palace was captured asked a third mana sailor along about eleven oclock we found out there werent anymore yunkers on the neva side so we broke in the doors andfiltered up the different stairways one by one or in littlebunches when we got to the top of the stairs the yunkers held usup and took away our guns still our fellows kept coming up littleby little until we had a majority then we turned around and tookaway the yunkers gunsjust then the commandant entereda merrylooking youngnoncommissioned officer with his arm in a sling and deep circlesof sleeplessness under his eyes his eye fell first on the prisonerwho at once began to explainoh yes interrupted the other you were one of the committee whorefused to surrender the staff wednesday afternoon however wedont want you citizen apologies he opened

from being hungry why should thecounterrevolutionists be treated so wellwe are revolutionists comrades not bandits answered thecommandant he turned to us we explained that rumours were goingabout that the yunkers were being tortured and the lives of theministers threatened could we perhaps see the prisoners so as tobe able to prove to the worldno said the young soldier irritably i am not going to

of that however one would never have realised thatcivil war was rending mighty russia in two and that the train washeaded into the zone of battle through the window we could see inthe swiftlydeepening darkness masses of soldiers going along themuddy road toward the city flinging out their arms in argument afreighttrain swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires washalted on a siding that was all back along the flat horizon theglow of the citys lights faded down the night a streetcar crawleddistantly along a farflung suburbtsarskoye selostation was quiet but knots of soldiers stood hereand there talking in low tones and looking uneasily down the emptytrack in the direction of gatchina i asked some of them which sidethey were on well said one we dont exactly know the rights ofthe matter there is no doubt that kerensky is a provocator but wedo not consider it right for russian men to be shooting russian menin the station commandants office was a big jovial bearded commonsoldier wearing the red armband of a regimental committee ourcredentials from smolny commanded immediate respect he was plainlyfor the soviets but bewilderedthe red guards were here two hours ago but they went away again acommissar came this morning but he returned to petrograd when thecossacks arrivedthe cossacks are here thenhe nodded gloomily there has been a battle the cossacks cameearly in the morning they captured two or three hundred of our menand killed about twentyfivewhere are the cossackswell they didnt get this far i dont know just where they areoff that way he waved his arm vaguely westwardwe had dinneran excellent dinner better and cheaper than could begot in petrogradin the station restaurant nearby sat a frenchofficer who had just come on foot from gatchina all was quietthere he said kerensky held the town ah these russians hewent on they are original what a civil war everything except thefightingwe sallied out into the town just at the door of the station stoodtwo soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed they were surrounded byabout a hundred business men government officials and students whoattacked them with passionate argument and epithet the soldierswere uncomfortable and hurt like children unjustly scoldeda tall young man with a supercilious expression dressed in theuniform of a student was leading the attackyou realise i presume he said insolently that by taking uparms against your brothers you are making yourselves the tools ofmurderers and traitorsnow brotheranswered the soldier earnestly you dont understandthere are two classes dont you see the proletariat and thebourgeoisie weoh i know that silly talk broke in the student rudely a bunchof ignorant peasants like you hear somebody bawling a fewcatchwords you dont understand what they mean you just echo themlike a lot of parrots the crowd laughed im a marxian studentand i tell you that this isnt socialism you are fighting for itsjust plain progerman anarchyoh yes i know answered the soldier with sweat dripping fromhis brow you are an educated man that is easy to see and i amonly a simple man but it seems to mei suppose interrupted the other contemptuously that you believelenin is a real friend of the proletariatyes i do answered the soldier sufferingwell my friend do you know that lenin was sent through germany ina closed car do you know that lenin took money from the germanswell i dont know much about that answered the soldierstubbornly but it seems to me that what he says is what i want tohear and all the simple men like me now there are two classes thebourgeoisie and the proletariatyou are a fool why my friend i spent two years in schlsselburgfor revolutionary activity when you were still shooting downrevolutionists and singing god save the tsar my name is vasiligeorgevitch panyin didnt you ever hear of meim sorry to say i never did answered the soldier with humilitybut then i am not an educated man you are probably a great heroi am said the student with conviction and i am opposed to thebolsheviki who are destroying our russia our free revolution nowhow do you account for thatthe soldier scratched his head i cant account for it at all hesaid grimacing with the pain of his intellectual processes to meit seems perfectly simplebut then im not well educated it seemslike there are only two classes the proletariat and thebourgeoisiethere you go again with your silly formula cried the studentonly two classes went on the soldier doggedlyldquoand whoever isnt on one side is on the otherwe wandered on up the street where the lights were few and farbetween and where people rarely passed a threatening silence hungover the placeas of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell apolitical no mans land only the barber shops were all brilliantlylighted and crowded and a line formed at the doors of the publicbath for it was saturday night when all russia bathes and perfumesitself i havent the slightest doubt that soviet troops andcossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were performedthe nearer we came to the imperial park the more deserted were thestreets a frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of thesoviet and hurried on it was in the wing of one of the grand ducalpalaces fronting the park the windows were dark the door lockeda soldier lounging about with his hands in the top of his trouserslooked us up and down with gloomy suspicion the soviet went awaytwo days ago said he where a shrug nie znayu i dontknowa little further along was a large building brightly illuminatedfrom within came a sound of hammering while we were hesitating asoldier and a sailor came down the street hand in hand i showedthem my pass from smolny are you for the soviets i asked theydid not answer but looked at each other in a frightened waywhat is going on in there asked the sailor pointing to thebuildingi dont knowtimidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a crackinside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens rows ofchairs a stage being builta stout woman with a hammer in her hand and her mouth full of tackscame out what do you want she askedis there a performance tonight said the sailor nervouslythere will be private theatricals sunday night she answeredseverely go awaywe tried to engage the soldier and sailor in conversation but theyseemed frightened and unhappy and drew off into the darknesswe strolled toward the imperial palaces along the edge of the vastdark gardens their fantastic pavilions and ornamental bridgeslooming uncertainly in the night and soft water splashing from thefountains at one place where a ridiculous iron swan spatunceasingly from an artificial grotto we were suddenly aware ofobservation and looked up to encounter the sullen suspicious gazeof half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers who stared moodily downfrom a grassy terrace i climbed up to them who are you i askedwe are the guard answered one they all looked very depressed asundoubtedly they were from weeks and weeks of allday allnightargument and debateare you kerenskys troops or the sovietsthere was silence for a moment as they looked uneasily at eachother then we are neutral said hewe went on through the arch of the huge ekaterina palace into thepalace enclosure itself asking for headquarters a sentry outside adoor in a curving white wing of the palace said that the commandantwas insidein a graceful white georgian room divided into unequal parts by atwosided fireplace a group of officers stood anxiously talkingthey were pale and distracted and evidently hadnt slept to onean oldish man with a white beard his uniform studded withdecorations who was pointed out as the colonel we showed ourbolshevik papershe seemed surprised how did you get here without being killed heasked politely it is very dangerous in the streets just nowpolitical passion is running very high in tsarskoye selo there wasa battle this morning and there will be another

the direction of petrogradtaking the artillery with them you might say that none of thesoldiers are for kerensky but some of them just dont want tofight at all the officers have almost all gone over to kerenskysforces or simply gone away we areahemin a most difficultposition as you seewe did not believe that there would be any battle the colonelcourteously sent his orderly to escort us to the railroad stationhe was from the south born of french immigrant parents inbessarabia ah he kept saying it is not the danger or thehardships i mind but being so long three years away from mymotherlooking out of the window of the train as we sped through the colddark toward petrograd i caught glimpses of clumps of soldiersgesticulating in the light of fires and of clusters of armouredcars halted together at crossroads the chauffeurs hanging out ofthe turrets and shouting to each otherall the troubled night over the bleakflats leaderless bands ofsoldiers and red guards

night once before on the th of november there had beena similar effort at conciliation led by martov and gorky but atthe approach of kerensky and the activity of the committee forsalvation the right wing of the mensheviki socialistrevolutionaries and populist socialists suddenly withdrew now theywere awed by the crushing of the yunker rebellionmonday the th was a day of suspense the eyes of all russia werefixed on the grey plain beyond the gates of petrograd where all theavailable strength of the old order faced the unorganised power ofthe new the unknown in moscow a truce had been declared bothsides parleyed awaiting the result in the capital now thedelegates to the congress of soviets hurrying on speeding trains tothe farthest reaches of asia were coming to their homes carryingthe fiery cross in widespreading ripples news of the miraclespread over the face of the land and in its wake towns cities andfar villages stirred and broke soviets and military revolutionarycommittees against dumas zemstvos and government commissarsredguards against whitestreet fighting and passionate speech theresult waited on the word from petrogradsmolny was almost empty but the duma was thronged and noisy theold mayor in his dignified way was protesting against the appealof the bolshevik councillorsthe duma is not a centre of counterrevolution he said warmlythe duma takes no part in the present struggle between the partiesbut at a time when there is no legal power in the land the onlycentre of order is the municipal selfgovernment the peacefulpopulation recognises this fact the foreign embassies recogniseonly such documents as are signed by the mayor of the town the mindof a european does not admit of any other situation as themunicipal selfgovernment is the only organ which is capable ofprotecting the interests of the citizens the city is bound to showhospitality to all organisations which desire to profit by suchhospitality and therefore the duma cannot prevent the distributionof any newspapers whatever within the duma building the sphere ofour work is increasing and we must be given full liberty of actionand our rights must be respected by both partieswe are perfectly neutral when the telephone exchange was occupiedby the yunkers colonel polkovnikov ordered the telephones tosmolny disconnected but i protested and the telephones were keptgoingat this there was ironic laughter from the bolshevik benches andimprecations from the rightand yet went on schreider they look upon us ascounterrevolutionaries and report us to the population theydeprive us of our means of transport by taking away our lastmotorcars it will not be our fault if there is famine in the townprotests are of no usekobozev bolshevik member of the town board was doubtful whetherthe military revolutionary committee had requisitioned the municipalautomobiles even granting the fact it was probably done by someunauthorised individual in the emergencythe mayor he continued tells us that we must not make politicalmeetings out of the duma but every menshevik and socialistrevolutionary here talks nothing but party propaganda and at thedoor they distribute their illegal newspapers iskri sparkssoldatski golos and rabotchaya gazeta inciting to insurrectionwhat if we bolsheviki should also begin to distribute our papershere but this shall not be for we respect the duma we have notattacked the municipal selfgovernment and we shall not do so butyou have addressed an appeal to the population and we are entitledalso to do sofollowed him shingariov cadet who said that there could be nocommon language with those who were liable to be brought before theattorney general for indictment and who must be tried on the chargeof treason he proposed again that all bolshevik members should beexpelled from the duma this was tabled however for there were nopersonal charges against the members and they were active in themunicipal administrationthen two mensheviki internationalists declaring that the appeal ofthe bolshevik councillors was a direct incitement to massacre ifeverything that is against the bolsheviki is counterrevolutionarysaid pinkevitch then i do not know the difference betweenrevolution and anarchy the bolsheviki are depending upon thepassions of the unbridled masses we have nothing but moral forcewe will protest against massacres and violence from both sides asour task is to find a peaceful issuethe notice posted in the streets under the heading to thepillory which calls upon the people to destroy the mensheviki andsocialist revolutionaries said nazariev is a crime which youbolsheviki will not be able to wash away yesterdays horrors arebut a preface to what you are preparing by such a proclamation ihave always tried to reconcile you with the other parties but atpresent i feel for you nothing but contemptthe bolshevik councillors were on their feet shouting angrilyassailed by hoarse hateful voices and waving armsoutside the hall i ran into the city engineer the menshevik gombergand three or four reporters they were all in high spiritssee they said the cowards are afraid of us they dont darearrest the duma their military revolutionary committee doesnt dareto send a commissar into this building why on the corner of thesadovaya today i saw a red guard try to stop a boy sellingsoldatski golos the boy just laughed at him and a crowd ofpeople wanted to lynch the bandit its only a few hours more noweven if kerensky wouldnt come they havent the men to run agovernment absurd i understand theyre even fighting amongthemselves at smolnya socialist revolutionary friend of mine drew me aside i knowwhere the committee for salvation is hiding he said do you wantto go and talk with themby this time it was dusk the city had again settled down tonormalshopshutters up lights shining and on the streets greatcrowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguingat number nevsky we went through a passage into a courtyardsurrounded by tall apartment buildings at the door of apartment my friend knocked in a peculiar way there was a sound of scufflingan inside door slammed then the front door opened a crack and awomans face appeared after a minutes observation she led us inaplacidlooking middleaged lady who at once cried kyril its allright in the diningroom where a samovar steamed on the table andthere were plates full of bread and raw fish a man in uniformemerged from behind the windowcurtains and another dressed like aworkman from a closet they were delighted to meet an americanreporter with a certain amount of gusto both said that they wouldcertainly be shot if the bolsheviki caught them they would not giveme their names but both were socialist revolutionarieswhy i asked do you publish such lies in your newspaperswithout taking offence the officer replied yes i know but whatcan we do he shrugged you must admit that it is necessary for usto create a certain frame of mind in the peoplethe other man interrupted this is merely an adventure on the partof the bolsheviki they have no intellectuals the ministrieswont work russia is not a city but a whole country realisingthat they can only last a few days we have decided to come to theaid of the strongest force opposed to themkerenskyand help torestore orderthat is all very well i said but why do you combine with thecadetsthe pseudoworkman smiled frankly to tell you the truth at thismoment the masses of the people are following the bolsheviki wehave no followingnow we cant mobilise a handful of soldiersthere are no arms available the bolsheviki are right to a certainextent there are at this moment in russia only two parties with anyforcethe bolsheviki and the reactionaries who are all hiding underthe coattails of the cadets the cadets think they are using usbut it is really we who are using the cadets when we smash thebolsheviki we shall turn against the cadetswill the bolsheviki be admitted into the new governmenthe scratched his head thats a problem he admitted of courseif they are not admitted theysll probably do this all over againat any rate they will have a chance to hold the balance of power inthe constituentthat is if there is a constituentand then too said the officer that brings up the question ofadmitting the cadets into the new governmentand for the samereasons you know the cadets do not really want the constituentassemblynot if the bolsheviki can be destroyed now he shook hishead it is not easy for us russians politics you americans areborn politicians you have had politics all your lives but foruswell it has only been a year you knowwhat do you think of kerensky i askedoh kerensky is guilty of the sins of the provisional governmentanswered the other man kerensky himself forced us to acceptcoalition with the bourgeoisie if he had resigned as hethreatened it would have meant a new cabinet crisis only sixteenweeks before the constituent assembly and that we wanted to avoidbut didnt it amount to that anywayyes but how were we to know they tricked usthe kerenskys andavksentievs gotz is a little more radical i stand with tchernovwho is a real revolutionist why only today lenin sent word thathe would not object to tchernov entering the governmentwe wanted to get rid of the kerensky government too but we thoughtit better to wait for the constituent at the beginning of thisaffair i was with the bolsheviki but the central committee of myparty voted unanimously against itand what could i do it was amatter of party disciplinein a week the bolshevik government will go to pieces if thesocialist revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait thegovernment would fall into their hands but if we wait a week thecountry will be so disorganised that the german imperialists will bevictorious that is why we began our revolt with only two regimentsof soldiers promising to support usand they turned against usthat left only the yunkershow about the cossacksthe officer sighed they did not move at first they said theywould come out if they had infantry support they said moreover thatthey had their men with kerensky and that they were doing theirpart then too they said that the cossacks were always accused ofbeing the hereditary enemies of democracy and finally thebolsheviki promise that they will not take away our land there isno danger to us we remain neutralduring this talk people were constantly entering and leavingmost ofthem officers their shoulderstraps torn off we could see them inthe hall and hear their low vehement voices occasionally throughthe halfdrawn portires we caught a glimpse of a door opening intoa bathroom where a heavilybuilt officer in a colonels uniformsat on the toilet writing something on a pad held in his lap irecognised colonel polkovnikov former commandant of petrograd forwhose arrest the military revolutionary committee would have paid afortuneour programme said the officer this is it land to be turnedover to the land committees workmen to have full representation inthe control of industry an energetic peace programme but not anultimatum to the world such as the bolsheviki issued the bolshevikicannot keep their promises to the masses even in the countryitself we wont let them they stole our land programme in orderto get the support of the peasants that is dishonest if they hadwaited for the constituent assemblyit doesnt matter about the constituent assembly broke in theofficer if the bolsheviki want to establish a socialist statehere we cannot work with them in any event kerensky made the greatmistake he let the bolsheviki know what he was going to do byannouncing in the council of the republic that he had ordered theirarrestbut what i said do you intend to do nowthe two men looked at one another you will see in a few days ifthere are enough troops from the front on our side we shall notcompromise with the bolsheviki if not perhaps we shall be forcedtoout

another tubfull of kasha was brought in a huge loaf of black bread and ofcourse the inevitable teapots at once every one began asking mequestions about america was it true that people in a free countrysold their votes for money if so how did they get what theywanted how about this tammany was it true that in a free countrya little group of people could control a whole city and exploitedit for their personal benefit why did the people stand it evenunder the tsar such things could not happen in russia true herethere was always graft but to buy and sell a whole city full ofpeople and in a free country had the people no revolutionaryfeeling i tried to explain that in my country people tried tochange things by lawof course nodded a young sergeant named baklanov who spokefrench but you have a highly developed capitalist class then thecapitalist class must control the legislatures and the courts howthen can the people change things i am open to conviction for i donot know your country but to me it is incrediblei said that i was going to tsarskoye selo i too said baklanovsuddenly and iand i the whole roomful decided on the spot to goto tsarskoye selojust then came a knock on

against my brother russiansprovocator kornilovitz the others cried at him gaily slappinghim on the shoulderpassing under the huge grey stone archway of the moskovsky gatecovered with golden hieroglyphics ponderous imperial eagles and thenames of tsars we sped out on the wide straight highway grey withthe first light fall of snow it was thronged with red guardsstumbling along on foot

and the pale suncame out across the flat marshy plain petrograd glittered to theright white and gilded and coloured bulbs and pinnacles to theleft tall chimneys some pouring out black smoke and beyond alowering sky over finland on each side of us were churchesmonasteries occasionally a monk was visible silently watching thepulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the roadat pulkovo the road divided and there we halted in the midst of agreat crowd where the human streams poured from three directionsfriends meeting excited and congratulatory describing the battleto one another a row of houses facing the crossroads was markedwith bullets and the earth was trampled into mud half a milearound the fighting had been furious here in the near distanceriderless cossack horses circled

itthey climbed into the truck and we proceeded it must have beenabout a mile further that vladimir nicolaievitch cocked his ear andshouted to the chauffeur to stopfiring he said do you hear it for a moment dead silence andthen a little ahead and to the left three shots in rapidsuccession along here the side of the road was heavily wooded verymuch excited now we crept along speaking in whispers until thetruck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come fromdescending we spread out and every man carrying his rifle wentstealthily into the foresttwo comrades meanwhile detached the cannon and slewed it arounduntil it aimed as nearly as possible at our backsit was silent in the woods the leaves were gone and thetreetrunks were a pale wan colour in the low sickly autumn sunnot a thing moved except the ice of little woodland pools shiveringunder our feet was it an ambushwe went uneventfully forward until the trees began to thin andpaused beyond in a little clearing three soldiers sat around asmall fire perfectly obliviousvladimir nicolaievitch stepped forward zrazvuitye comradeshe greeted while behind him one cannon twenty rifles and atruckload of grubit bombs hung by

about the formation of the new governmenti dont know anything about that i am not taking part in thenegotiations however i dont think that they are of greatimportancethat night there was great uneasiness in the conference thedelegates of the city duma withdrewbut at smolny itself in the ranks of the bolshevik party aformidable opposition to lenins policy was growing on the night ofnovember

withpolitical terrorismthe measures taken against the freedom of the press should bemodified they had their reason during the struggle but now theyhave no further excuse the press should be free except for appealsto riot and insurrectionin a storm of hisses and hoots from his own party larin offered thefollowing resolutionthe decree of the council of peoples commissars concerning thepress is herewith repealedmeasures of political repression can only be employed subject todecision of a special tribunal elected by the tsayeekahproportionally to the strength of the different parties representedand this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider measuresof repression already takenthis was met by a thunder of applause not only from the leftsocialist revolutionaries but also from a part of the bolshevikiavanessov for the leninites hastily proposed that the question ofthe press be postponed until after some compromise between thesocialist parties had been reached overwhelmingly voted downthe revolution which is now being accomplished went on avanessovhas not hesitated to attack private property and it is as privateproperty that we must examine the question of the pressthereupon he read the official bolshevik resolutionthe suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only bypurely military needs in the course of the insurrection and for thechecking of counterrevolutionary action but it is also necessaryas a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new rgimewith regard to the pressa rgime under which the capitalist ownersof printingpresses and of paper cannot be the allpowerful andexclusive manufacturers of public opinionwe must further proceed to the confiscation of private printingplants and supplies of paper which should become the property ofthe soviets both in the capital and in the provinces so that thepolitical parties and groups can make use of the facilities ofprinting in proportion to the actual strength of the ideas theyrepresentin other words proportionally to the number of theirconstituentsthe restablishment of the socalled freedom of the press thesimple return of printing presses and paper to thecapitalistspoisoners of the mind of the peoplethis would be aninadmissible surrender to the will of capital a giving up of one ofthe most important conquests of the revolution in other words itwould be a measure of unquestionably counterrevolutionary characterproceeding from the above the tsayeekah categorically rejectsall propositions aiming at the restablishment of the old rgime inthe domain of the press and unequivocally supports the point ofview of the council of peoples commissars on this question againstpretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty bourgeois prejudicesor by evident surrender to the interests of thecounterrevolutionary bourgeoisiethe reading of this resolution was interrupted by ironical shoutsfrom the left socialist revolutionaries and bursts of indignationfrom the insurgent bolsheviki karelin was on his feet protestingthree weeks ago the bolsheviki were the most ardent defenders ofthe freedom of the press the arguments in this resolution suggestsingularly the point of view of the old black hundreds and thecensors of the tsarist rgimefor they also talked of poisoners ofthe mind of the peopletrotzky spoke at length in favour of the resolution hedistinguished between the press during the civil war and the pressafter the victory during civil war the right to use violencebelongs only to the oppressed cries of whos the oppressed nowcannibalthe victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved and thenewspapers are arms in their hands in these conditions the closingof the newspapers is a legitimate measure of defence then passingto the question of the press after the victory trotzky continuedthe attitude of socialists on the question of freedom of the pressshould be the same as their attitude toward the freedom ofbusiness the rule of the democracy which is being established inrussia demands that the domination of the press by private propertymust be abolished just as the domination of industry by privateproperty the power of the soviets should confiscate allprintingplants cries confiscate the printingshop ofpravdathe monopoly of the press by the bourgeoisie must be abolishedotherwise it isnt worth while for us to take the power each groupof citizens should have access to print shops and paper theownership of printtype and of paper belongs first to the workersand peasants and only afterwards to the bourgeois parties whichare in a minority the passing of the power into the hands of thesoviets will bring about a radical transformation of the essentialconditions of existence and this transformation will necessarily beevident in the press if we are going to nationalise the banks canwe then tolerate the financial journals the old rgime must diethat must be understood once and for all applause and angry crieskarelin declared that the tsayeekah had no right to pass uponthis important question which should be left to a specialcommittee again passionately he demanded that the press be freethen lenin calm unemotional his forehead wrinkled as he spokeslowly choosing his words each sentence falling like ahammerblow the civil war is not yet finished the enemy is stillwith us consequently it is impossible to abolish the measures ofrepression against the presswe bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a position ofpower we would close the bourgeois press to tolerate the bourgeoisnewspapers would mean to cease being a socialist when one makes arevolution one cannot mark time one must always go forwardor goback he who now talks about the freedom of the press goesbackward and halts our headlong course toward socialismwe have thrown off the yoke of capitalism just as the firstrevolution threw off the yoke of tsarism if the first revolutionhad the right to suppress the monarchist papers then we have theright to suppress the bourgeois press it is impossible to separatethe question of the freedom of the press from the other questions ofthe class struggle we have promised to close these newspapers andwe shall do it the immense majority of the people is with usnow that the insurrection is over we have absolutely no desire tosuppress the papers of the other socialist parties except inasmuchas they appeal to armed insurrection or to disobedience to thesoviet government however we shall not permit them under thepretence of freedom of the socialist press to obtain through thesecret support of the bourgeoisie a monopoly of printingpressesink and paper these essentials must become the property of thesoviet government and be apportioned first of all to thesocialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strengththen the vote the resolution of larin and the left socialistrevolutionaries was defeated by to the lenin motion

eighty per cent ofthe people of russia the bolsheviki had a comparatively smallfollowing among the peasants and a permanent dictatorship of russiaby the industrial workers was impossible the traditional peasantparty was the socialist revolutionary party of all the parties nowsupporting the soviet government the left socialist revolutionarieswere the logical inheritors of peasant

after the landdecree one of the first actions of the new tsayeekah had beento call a congress of peasants over the head of the executivecommittee of the peasants soviets a few days later was issueddetailed regulations for the volost township land committeesfollowed by lenins instruction to peasants see app xii sect which explained the bolshevik revolution and the new governmentin simple terms and on november th lenin and miliutin publishedthe instructions to provincial emissaries of whom thousands weresent by the soviet government into the villages upon his arrival in the province to which he is accredited theemissary should call a joint meeting of the central executivecommittees of the soviets of workers soldiers and peasantsdeputies to whom he should make a report on the agrarian laws andthen demand that a joint plenary session of the soviets be summoned he must study the aspects of the agrarian problem in the provincea has the landowners property been taken over and if so in whatdistrictsb who administers the confiscated landthe former proprietor orthe land committeesc what has been done with the agricultural machinery and with thefarmanimals has the ground cultivated by the peasants been augmented how much and in what respect does the amount of land now undercultivation differ from the amount fixed by the government as anaverage minimum the emissary must insist that after the peasants have receivedthe land it is imperative that they increase the amount ofcultivated land as quickly as possible and that they hasten thesending of grain to the cities as the only means of avoiding famine what are the measures projected or put into effect for thetransfer of land from the landowners to the land committees andsimilar bodies appointed by the soviets it is desirable that agricultural properties well appointed andwell organised should be administered by soviets composed of theregular employees of those properties under the direction ofcompetent agricultural scientistsall through the villages a ferment of change was going on causednot only by the electrifying action of the land decree but also bythousands of revolutionaryminded peasantsoldiers returning fromthe front these men especially welcomed the call to a congressof peasantslike the old tsayeekah in the matter of the second congress ofworkers and soldiers soviets the executive committee tried toprevent the peasant congress summoned by smolny and like the oldtsayeekah finding its resistance futile the executivecommittee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election ofconservative delegates word was even spread among the peasants thatthe congress would meet at moghilev and some delegates went therebut by november d about four hundred had gathered in petrogradand the party caucuses had begunthe first session took place in the alexander hall of the dumabuilding and the first vote showed that more than half of all thedelegates were left socialist revolutionaries while the bolshevikicontrolled a bare fifth the conservative socialist revolutionariesa quarter and all the rest were united only in their opposition tothe old executive committee dominated by avksentiev tchaikovskyand peshekhonovthe great hall was jammed with people and shaken with continualclamour deep stubborn bitterness divided the delegates into angrygroups to the right was a sprinkling of officers epaulettes andthe patriarchal bearded faces of the older more substantialpeasants in the centre were a few peasants noncommissionedofficers and some soldiers and on the left almost all thedelegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers these last were theyoung generation who had been serving in the army the gallerieswere thronged with workerswho in russia still remember theirpeasant originunlike the old tsayeekah the executive committee in openingthe session did not recognise the congress as official theofficial congress was called for december th amid a hurricane ofapplause and angry cries the speaker declared that this gatheringwas merely extraordinary conference but the extraordinaryconference soon showed its attitude toward the executive committeeby electing as presiding officer maria spiridonova leader of theleft socialist revolution ariesmost of the first day was taken up by a violent debate as to whetherthe representatives of volost soviets should be seated or onlydelegates from the provincial bodies and just as in the workersand soldiers congress an overwhelming majority declared in favourof the widest possible representation whereupon the old executivecommittee left the hallalmost immediately it was evident that most of the delegates werehostile to the government of the peoples commissars zinovievattempting to speak for the bolsheviki was hooted down and as heleft the platform amid laughter there were cries theres how apeoples commissar sits in a mudpuddlewe left socialist revolutionaries refuse cried nazariev adelegate from the provinces to recognise this socalled workersand peasants government until the peasants are represented in itat present it is nothing but a dictatorship of the workers weinsist upon the formation of a new government which will representthe entire democracythe reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered this feeling declaringin the face of protests from the bolshevik benches that the councilof peoples commissars intended either to control the congress ordissolve it by force of armsan announcement which was received bythe peasants with bursts of furyon the third day lenin suddenly mounted the tribune for ten minutesthe room went mad down with him they shrieked we will notlisten to any of your peoples commissars we dont recognise yourgovernmentlenin stood there quite calmly gripping the desk with both handshis little eyes thoughtfully surveying the tumult beneath finallyexcept for the right side of the hall the demonstration wore itselfout somewhati do not come here as a member of the council of peoplescommissars said lenin and waited again for the noise to subsidebut as a member of the bolshevik faction duly elected to thiscongress and he held his credentials up to that all might see themhowever he went on in an unmoved voice nobody will deny thatthe present government of russia has been formed by the bolshevikparty he had to wait a moment so that for all purposes it is thesame thing here the right benches broke into deafening clamourbut the centre and left were curious and compelled silencelenins argument was simple tell me frankly you peasants to whomwe have given the lands of the pomieshtchiki do you want now toprevent the workers from getting control of industry this is classwar the pomieshtchiki of course oppose the peasants and

soviets are the most perfect representatives of the peopleofthe workers in the factories and mines of the workers in thefields anybody who attempts to destroy the soviets is guilty of anantidemocratic and counterrevolutionary act and i serve noticehere on you comrades right socialist revolutionariesand on youmessrs cadetsthat if the constituent assembly attempts to destroythe soviets we shall not permit the constituent assembly to do thisthingon the afternoon of november th tchernov arrived in hot haste frommoghilev summoned by the executive committee only two monthsbefore considered an extreme revolutionist and very popular withthe peasants he was now called to check the dangerous drift of thecongress toward the left upon his arrival tchernov was arrested andtaken to smolny where after a short conversation he was releasedhis first act was to bitterly rebuke the executive committee forleaving the congress they agreed to return and tchernov enteredthe hall welcomed with great applause by the majority and thehoots and jeers of the bolshevikicomrades i have been away i participated in the conference of thetwelfth army on the question of calling a congress of all thepeasant delegates of the armies of the western front and i knowvery little about the insurrection which occurred herezinoviev rose in his seat and shouted yes you were awayfor afew minutes fearful tumult cries down with the bolshevikitchernov continued the accusation that i helped lead an army onpetrograd has no foundation and is entirely false where does suchan accusation come from show me the sourcezinoviev izviestia and dielo narodayour own paper thatswhere it comes fromtchernovs wide face with the small eyes waving hair and greyishbeard became red with wrath but he controlled himself and went oni repeat i know practically nothing about what has happened hereand i did not lead any army except this army he pointed to thepeasant delegates which i am largely responsible for bringinghere laughter and shouts of bravoupon my return i visited smolny no such accusation was madeagainst me there after a brief conversation i leftand thats alllet any one present make such an accusationan uproar followed in which the bolsheviki and some of the leftsocialist revolutionaries were on their feet all at once shakingtheir fists and yelling and the rest of the assembly tried to yellthem downthis is an outrage not a session cried tchernov and he left thehall the meeting was adjourned because of the noise and disordermeanwhile the question of the status of the executive committee wasagitating all minds by declaring the assembly extraordinaryconference it had been planned to block the reelection of theexecutive committee but this worked both ways the left socialistrevolutionists decided that if the congress had no power over theexecutive committee then the executive committee had no power overthe congress on november th the assembly resolved that the powersof the executive committee be assumed by the extraordinaryconference in which only members of the executive who had beenelected as delegates might votethe next day in spite of the bitter opposition of the bolshevikithe resolution was amended to give all the members of the executivecommittee whether elected as delegates or not voice and vote inthe assemblyon the th occurred the debate on the land question which revealedthe differences between the agrarian programme of the bolsheviki andthe left socialist revolutionarieskolchinsky for the left socialist revolutionaries outlined thehistory of the land question during the revolution the firstcongress of peasants soviets he said had voted a precise andformal resolution in favour of putting the landed estatesimmediately into the hands of the land committees but the directorsof the revolution and the bourgeois in the government had insistedthat the question could not be solved until the constituent assemblymet the second period of the revolution the period ofcompromisewas signalled by the entrance of tchernov into thecabinet the peasants were convinced that now the practical solutionof the land question would begin but in spite of the imperativedecision of the first peasant congress the reactionaries andconciliators in the executive committee had prevented any actionthis policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders which appearedas the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on thepart of the peasants the peasants understood the exact meaning ofthe revolutionthey tried to turn words into actionthe recent events said the orator do not indicate a simpleriot or a bolshevik adventure but on the contrary a realpopular rising which has been greeted with sympathy by the wholecountrythe bolsheviki in general took the correct attitude toward the landquestion but in recommending that the peasants seize the land byforce they committed a profound error from the first days thebolsheviki declared that the peasants should take over the land byrevolutionary massaction this is nothing but anarchy the land canbe taken over in an organised manner for the bolsheviki it wasimportant that the problems of the revolution should be solved inthe quickest possible mannerbut the bolsheviki were not interestedin how these problems were to be solvedthe land decree of the congress of soviets is identical in itsfundamentals with the decisions of the first peasants congress whythen did not the new government follow the tactics outlined by thatcongress because the council of peoples commissars wanted tohasten the settlement of the land question so that the constituentassembly would have nothing to dobut also the government saw that it was necessary to adoptpractical measures so without further reflection it adopted theregulations for land committees thus creating a strange situationfor the council of peoples commissars abolished private property inland but the regulations drawn up by the land committees are basedon private property however no harm has been done by that forthe land committees are paying no attention to the soviet decreesbut are putting into operation their own practicaldecisionsdecisions based on the will of the vast majority of thepeasantsthese land committees are not attempting the legislative solutionof the land question which belongs to the constituent assemblyalone but will the constituent assembly desire to do the will ofthe russian peasants of that we cannot be sure all we can be sureof is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants is nowaroused and that the constituent will be forced to settle theland question the way the peasants want it settled the constituentassembly will not dare to break with the will of the peoplefollowed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity atthis moment we are not only trying to solve the land question butthe question of social revolutionnot only here in russia but allover the world the land question cannot be solved independently ofthe other problems of the social revolution for example theconfiscation of the landed estates will provoke the resistance notonly of russian landowners but also of foreign capitalwith whomthe great landed properties are connected through the intermediaryof the banksthe ownership of the land in russia is the basis for immenseoppression and the confiscation of the land by the peasants is themost important step of our revolution but it cannot be separatedfrom the other steps as is clearly manifested by the stages throughwhich the revolution has had to pass the first stage was thecrushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of theindustrial capitalists and landowners whose interests are closelyrelated the second stage was the strengthening of the soviets andthe political compromise with the bourgeoisie the mistake of theleft socialist revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that timethey did not oppose the policy of compromise because they held thetheory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet fullydevelopedif socialism can only be realised when the intellectualdevelopment of all the people permits it then we shall not seesocialism for at least five hundred years the socialist politicalpartythis is the vanguard of the workingclass it must not allowitself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass averagebut it must lead the masses using the soviets as organs ofrevolutionary initiative but in order to lead the wavering thecomrades left socialist revolutionaries themselves must stophesitatingin july last a series of open breaks began between the popularmasses and the compromisers but now in november the leftsocialist revolutionaries are still holding out their hand toavksentiev who is pulling the people with his little finger ifcompromise continues the revolution disappears no compromise withthe bourgeoisie is possible its power must be absolutely crushedwe bolsheviki have not changed our land programme we have notgiven up the abolition of private property in the land and we donot intend to do so we adopted the regulations for landcommitteeswhich are not based on private property at allbecausewe want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people havethemselves decided to do it so as to draw closer the coalition ofall the elements who are fighting for the social revolutionwe invite the left socialist revolutionaries to enter thatcoalition insisting however that they cease looking backward andthat they break with the conciliators of their partyas far as the constituent assembly is concerned it is true as thepreceding speaker has said that the work of the constituent willdepend on the revolutionary determination of the masses i saycount on that revolutionary determination but dont forget yourgunlenin then read the bolshevik resolutionthe peasants congress fully supporting the land decree of novemberth approves of the provisional workers and peasants governmentof the russian republic established by the second allrussiancongress of soviets of workers and soldiers deputiesthe peasants congress invites all peasants unanimously to sustainthat law and to apply it immediately themselves and at the sametime invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions ofresponsibility only persons who have proved not by words but byacts their entire devotion to the interests of the exploitedpeasantworkers their desire and their ability to defend theseinterests against all resistance on the part of the greatlandowners the capitalists their partisans and accomplicesthe peasants congress at the same time expresses its convictionthat the complete realisation of all the measures which make up theland decree can only be successful through the triumph of theworkers social revolution which began november th for onlythe social revolution can accomplish the definite transfer withoutpossibility of return of the land to the peasantworkers theconfiscation of model farms and their surrender to the peasantcommunes the confiscation of agricultural machinery belonging tothe great landowners the safeguarding of the interests of theagricultural workers by the complete abolition of wageslavery theregular and methodical distribution among all regions of russia ofthe products of agriculture and industry and the seizure of thebanks without which the possession of land by the whole peoplewould be impossible after the abolition of private property andall sorts of assistance by the state to the workersfor these reasons the peasants congress sustains entirely therevolution of november th as a social revolution and expressesits unalterable will to put into operation with whatevermodifications are necessary but without any hesitation the socialtransformation of the russian republicthe indispensable conditions of the victory of the socialrevolution which alone will secure the lasting success and thecomplete realisation of the land decree is the close union of thepeasantworkers with the industrial workingclass with theproletariat of all advanced countries from now on in the russianrepublic all the organisation and administration of the state fromtop to bottom must rest on that union that union crushing allattempts direct or indirect open or dissimulated to return to thepolicy of conciliation with the bourgeoisieconciliation damned byexperience with the chiefs of bourgeois politicscan alone insurethe victory of socialism throughout the worldthe reactionaries of the executive committee no longer dared openlyto appear tchernov however spoke several times with a modest andwinning impartiality he was invited to sit on the platform on thesecond night of the congress an anonymous note was handed up to thechairman requesting that tchernov be made honorary presidentustinov read the note aloud and immediately zinoviev was on hisfeet screaming that this was a trick of the old executive

question and the lenin resolutionthe bolsheviki were twice on the point of quitting the assemblyboth times restrained by their leaders it seemed to me as if thecongress were hopelessly deadlockedbut none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were alreadygoing on between the left socialist revolutionaries and thebolsheviki at smolny at first the left socialist revolutionarieshad demanded

kornilovs attempt is now pretty clearlyestablished many apologists for kerensky say that he knew ofkornilovs plans and by a trick drew him out prematurely and thencrushed him even mr a j sack in his book the birth of therussian democracy saysseveral things are almost certain the first is that kerensky knewabout the movement of several detachments from the front towardpetrograd and it is possible that as prime minister and minister ofwar realising the growing bolshevist danger he called for themthe only flaw in that argument is that there was no bolshevistdanger at that time the bolsheviki

born of the will of allclasses of the russian people the first rough form of the futureliberal parliamentary rgime has been formed ahead of us is theconstituent assembly which will solve all questions of fundamentallaw and whose composition will be essentially democratic thefunction of the soviets is at an end and the time is approachingwhen they must retire with the rest of the revolutionary machineryfrom the stage of a free and victorious people whose weapons shallhereafter be the peaceful ones of political actionthe leading article of izviestia for october d was called thecrisis in the soviet organisations it began by saying thattravellers reported a lessening activity of local soviets everywherethis is natural said the writer for the people are becominginterested in the more permanent legislative organsthe municipaldumas and the zemstvsin the important centres of petrograd and moscow where the sovietswere best organised they did not take in all the democraticelements the majority of the intellectuals did not participate andmany workers also some of the workers because they were politicallybackward others because the centre of gravity for them was in theirunns we cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united withthe masses whose everyday needs are better served by themthat the local democratic administrations are being energeticallyorganised is highly important the city dumas are elected byuniversal suffrage and in purely local matters have more authoritythan the soviets not a single democrat will see anything wrong inthis elections to the municipalities are being conduct in a better andmore democratic way than the elections to the soviets all classesare represented in the municipalities and as soon as the localselfgovernments begin to organise life in the municipalities therle of the local soviets naturally ends there are two factors in the falling off of interest in thesoviets the first we may attribute to the lowering of politicalinterest in the masses the second to the growing effort ofprovincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of newrussia the more the tendency lies in this latter direction thesooner disappears the significance of the sovietswe ourselves are being called the undertakers of our ownorganisation in reality we ourselves are the hardest workers inconstructing the new russiawhen autocracy and the whole bureaucratic rgimeell we set up thesoviets as a barracks in which all the democracy cod find temporaryshelter now instead of barracks we are building the permanentedifice of a new system and naturally the people will graduallyleave the barracks for more comfortable quarters trotzkys speech at the council of the russin republicthe purpose of the democratic conference which was called by thetsayeekah was to do away with the irresponsible personalgovernment which produced kornilov and to establish a responsiblegovernment which would be capable of finishing the war and ensurethe calling of the constituent assembly at the given time in themeanwhile behind the back of the democratic conference by trickeryby deals between citizen kerensky the cadets and the leaders of themenshevik and socialist revolutionary parties we received theopposite result from the officially announced purpose a power wascreated around which and in which we have open and secret kornilovsplaying leading parts the irresponsibility of the government isoffically proclaimed when it is announced that the council of therussian republic is to be a consultative and not legislativebody in the eighth month of the revolution the irresponsiblegovernment creates a cover for itself in this new edition ofbieligens dumathe propertied classes have entered this provision council in aproportion which clearly shows from elections all over the countrythat many of them have no right here whatever in spite of that thecadet party which until yesterday wanted the provisional governmentto be responsible to the state dumathis same cadet party secured theindependence assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have asfavourable position than they have in this council and they will notbe able to be irresponsible to the constituent assemblyif the propertied classes were really getting ready for theconstituent assembly six weeks from now there could be no reason forestablishing the irresponsibility of the government at this time thewhole truth is that the bourgeoisie which directs the policies ofthe provisional government has for its aim to break the constituentassembly at present this is the main purpose of the propertiedclasses which control our entire national policyexternal andinternal in the industrial agrarian and supply departments thepolitics of the propertied classes acting with the governmentincreases the natural disorganisation caused by the war thepropertied classes which are provoking a peasants revolt thepropertied classes which are provoking civil war and openly holdtheir course on the bony hand of hunger with which they intend tooverthrow the revolution and finish with the constituent assemblyno less criminal also is the international policy of the bourgeoisieand its government after forty months of war the capital isthreatened with mortal danger in reply to this arises a plan to movethe government to moscow the idea of abandoning the capital does notstir the indignation of the bourgeoisie just the opposite it isaccepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to promotecounterrevolutionary conspiracy instead of recognising that thesalvation of the country lies in concluding peace instead ofthrowing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the wornoutpeoples

negotiations of an english agent with abulgarian church dignitary all pointed to the fact that there werestrong currents on both sides favourable to patching up a peace atthe expense of russia in my next book kornilov to brestlitovski intend to treat this matter at some length publishing severalsecret documents discovered in the ministry of foreign affairs atpetrograd russian soldiers in franceofficial report of the provisional governmentfrom the time the news of the russian revolution reached parisrussian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began to appearand these newspapers as well as individuals freely circulated amongthe soldier masses and began a bolshevik propaganda often spreadingfalse news which appeared in the french journals in the absence ofall official news and of precise details this campaign provokeddiscontent among the soldiers the result was a desire to return torussia and a hatred toward the officersfinally it all turned into rebellion in one of their meetings thesoldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill since they had decidedto fight no more it was decided to isolate the rebels and generalzankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the provisional governmentto leave the camp of courtine and to carry with them all ammunitionon june th the order was executed there remained at the camp onlythe soldiers who said they would submit conditionally to theprovisional government the soldiers at the camp of courtine receivedseveral times the visit of the commanderinchief of the russianarmies abroad of rapp the commissar of the ministry of war and ofseveral distinguished former exiles who wished to influence them butthese attempts were unsuccessful and finally commissar rapp insistedthat the rebels lay down their arms and in sign of submissionmarch in good order to a place called clairvaux the order was onlypartially obeyed first men went out of whom were arrested hours later about followed about remainedit was decided to increase the pressure their rations werediminished their pay was cut off and the roads toward the villageof courtine were guarded by french soldiers general zankievitchhaving discovered that a russian artillery brigade was passingthrough france decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry andartillery to reduce the rebels a deputation was sent to the rebelsthe deputation returned several hours later convinced of thefutility of the negotiations on september st general zankievitchsent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down theirarms and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery ifthe order was not obeyed by september d at oclockthe order not being executed a light fire of artillery was openedon the place at the hour agreed upon eighteen shells were fired andthe rebels were warned that the bombardment would become moreintense in the night of september d men surrendered septemberth the artillery bombardment recommenced and at oclock after shells had been fired the rebels raised two white flags and beganto leave the camp without arms by evening men had surrendered soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with machinegunsthat night the th of september to make an end of the affair aheavy barrage was laid on the camp and our soldiers occupied itlittle by little the rebels kept up a heavy fire with theirmachineguns september th at oclock the camp was entirelyoccupied after the disarmament of the rebels arrests weremadethus the report from secret documents discovered in the ministry offoreign affairs however we know that the account is not strictlyaccurate the first trouble arose when the soldiers tried to formcommittees as their comrades in russia were doing they demanded tobe sent back to russia which was refused and then being considereda dangerous influence in france they were ordered to salonika theyrefused to go and the battle followed it was discovered that theyhad been left in camp without officers for about two months andbadly treated before they became rebellious all attempts to findout the name of the russian artillery brigade which had fired onthem were futile the telegrams discovered in the ministry left it tobe inferred that french artillery was usedafter their surrender more than two hundred of the mutineers wereshot in cold blood terestchenkos speech resum the questions of foreign policy are closely related to those ofnational defence and so if in questions of national defence youthink it is necessary to hold session in secret also in our foreignpolicy we are sometimes forced to observe the same secrecygerman diplomacy attempts to influence public opinion thereforethe declarations of directors of great democratic organisations whotalk loudly of a revolutionary congress and the impossibility ofanother winter campaign are dangerous all these declarations costhuman livesi wish to speak merely of governmental logic without touching thequestions of the honour and dignity of the state from the point ofview of logic the foreign policy of russia ought to be based on areal comprehension of the interests of russia these interestsmean that it is impossible that our country remain alone and thatthe present alignment of forces with us the allies issatisfactory all humanity longs for peace but in russia no onewill permit a humiliating peace which would violate the stateinterests of our fatherlandthe orator pointed out that such a peace would for long years if notfor centuries retard the triumph of democratic principles in theworld and would inevitably cause new warsall remember the days of may when the fraternisation on our frontthreatened to end the war by a simple cessation of militaryoperations and lead the country to a shameful separate peace andwhat efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier masses atthe front understand that it was not by this method that the russianstate must end the war and guarantee its interesthe spoke of the miraculous effect of the july offensive whatstrength it gave to the words of russian ambassadors abroad and thedespair in germany caused by the russian victories and also thedisillusionment in allied countries which followed the russiandefeatas to the russian government it adhered strictly to the formula ofmay no annexations and no punitive indemnities we consider itessential not only to proclaim the selfdetermination of peoples butalso to renounce imperialist aimsgermany is continually trying to make peace the only talk in germanyis of peace she knows she cannot wini reject the reproaches aimed at the government which allege thatrussian foreign policy does not speak clearly enough about the aimsof the warif the question arises as to what ends the allies are pursuing itis indispensable first to demand what aims the central powers haveagreed uponthe desire is often heard that we publish the details of thetreaties which bind the allies but people forget that up to now wedo not know the treaties which bind the central powersgermany he said evidently wants to separate russia from the west bya series of weak bufferstatesthis tendency to strike at the vital interests of russia must becheckedand will the russian democracy which has inscribed on its bannerthe rights of nations to dispose of themselves allow calmly thecontinuation of oppression upon the most civilised peoples inaustriahungarythose who fear that the allies will try to profit by our difficultsituation to make us support more than our share of the burden ofwar and to solve the questions of peace at our expense are entirelymistaken our enemy looks upon russia as a market for its productsthe end of the war will leave us in a feeble condition and with ourfrontier open the flood of german products can easily hold back foryears our industrial development measures must be taken to guardagainst thisi say openly and frankly the combination of forces which unites usto the allies is favourable to the interests of russia it istherefore important that our views on the questions of war and peaceshall be in accord with the views of the allies as clearly andprecisely as possible to avoid all misunderstanding i must sayfrankly that russia must present at the paris conference one pointof viewhe did not want to comment on the nakaz to skobeliev but hereferred to the manifesto of the dutchscandinavian committee justpublished in stockholm this manifesto declared for the autonomy oflithuania and livonia but that is clearly impossible saidterestchenko for russia must have free ports on the baltic all theyear roundin this question the problems of foreign policy are also closelyrelated to interior politics for if there existed a strong sentimentof unity of all great russia one would not witness the repeatedmanifestations everywhere of a desire of peoples to separate fromthe central government such separations are contrary to theinterests of russia and the russian delegates cannot raise theissue the british fleet etcat the time of the naval battle of the gulf of riga not only thebolsheviki but also the ministers of the provisional governmentconsidered that the british fleet had deliberately abandoned thebaltic as one indication of the attitude so often expressed publiclyby the british press and semipublicly by british representatives inrussia russias finished no use bothering about russiasee interview with kerensky appendix general gurko was a former chief of staff of the russian armies underthe tsar he was a prominent figure in the corrupt imperial courtafter the revolution he was one of the very few persons exiled forhis political and personal record the russian naval defeat in thegulf of riga coincided with the public reception by king george inlondon of general gurko a man whom the russian provisionalgovernment considered dangerously progerman as well as reactionary appeals against insurrection to workers and soldierscomrades the dark forces are increasingly trying to call forth inpetrograd and other towns disorders and pogroms disorder isnecessary to the dark forces for disorder will give them anopportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood underthe pretext of establishing order and of protecting the inhabitantsthey hope to establish the domination of kornilov which therevolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago woe tothe people if these hopes are realised the triumphantcounterrevolution will destroy the soviets and the army committeeswill disperse the constituent assembly will stop the transfer of theland to the land committees will put an end to all the hopes of thepeople for a speedy peace and will fill all the prisons withrevolutionary soldiers and workersin their calculations the counterrevolutionists and black hundredleaders are counting on the serious discontent of the unenlightenedpart of the people with the disorganisation of the foodsupply thecontinuation of the war and the general difficulties of life theyhope to transform every demonstration of soldiers and workers into apogrom which will frighten the peaceful population and throw itinto the arms of the restorers of law and orderunder such conditions every attempt to organise a demonstration inthese days although for the most laudable object would be a crimeall conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the policyof the government will only bring injury to themselves and to therevolution if they indulge in demonstrationstherefore the tsayeekah asks all workers not to obey any callsto demonstrateworkers and soldiers

go go to the ignorant people seduced by the betrayers and tellthem the whole truth which we have told youlet all know that every man who in these terrible days calls on youto come out in the streets

conscious peasant everyrevolutionary soldier all who understand what harm a demonstrationor a revolt against the government might cause to the people mustjoin together and not allow the enemies of the people to destroy ourfreedomthe petrograd electoral committee of the menshevikioborontzi lenins letter to the comradesthis series of articles appeared in rabotchi put several daysrunning at the end of october and beginning of november igive here only extracts from two instalments kameniev and riazanov say that we have not a majority among thepeople and that without a majority insurrection is hopelessanswer people capable of speaking such things are falsifierspedants or simply dont want to look the real situation in the facein the last elections we received in all the country more than fiftyper cent of all thevotesthe most important thing in russia today is the peasantsrevolution in tambov government there has been a real agrarianuprising with wonderful political results even dielo naroda hasbeen scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to thepeasants and not only the socialist revolutionaries in the councilof the republic but also the government itself has been similarlyaffected another valuable result was the bringing of bread which hadbeen hoarded by the pomieshtchiki to the railroad stations in thatprovince the russkaya volia had to admit that the stations werefilled with bread after the peasants rising we are not sufficiently strong to take over the government andthe bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to prevent the constituentassemblyanswer this is nothing but timidity expressed by pessimism asregards workers and soldiers and optimism as regards the failure ofthe bourgeoisie if yunkers and cossacks say they will fight youbelieve them if workmen and soldiers say so you doubt it what isthe distinction between such doubts and siding politically with thebourgeoisiekornilov proved that the soviets were really a power to believekerensky and the council of the republic if the bourgeoisie is notstrong enough to break the soviets it is not strong enough to breakthe constituent but that is wrong the bourgeoisie will break theconstituent by sabotage by lockouts by giving up petrograd byopening the front to the germans this has already been done in thecase of riga the soviets must remain a revolver at the head of the governmentto force the calling of the constituent assembly and to suppress anyfurther kornilov attemptsanswer refusal of insurrection is refusal of all power to thesoviets since september the bolshevik party has been discussing thequestion of insurrection refusing to rise means to trust our hopesin the faith of the good bourgeoisie who have promised to call theconstituent assembly when the soviets have all the power thecalling of the constituent is guaranteed and its success assuredrefusal of insurrection means surrender to the lieberdans eitherwe must drop all power to the soviets or make an insurrectionthere is no middle course the bourgeoisie cannot give up petrograd although the rodziankoswant it because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting but ourheroic soldiers and sailorsanswer this did not prevent two admirals from running away at themoonsund battle the staff has not changed it is composed ofkornilovtsi if the staff with kerensky at its head wants to giveup petrograd it can do it doubly or trebly it can make arrangementswith the germans or the british open the fronts it can sabotage thearmys food supply at all these doors has it knockedwe have no right to wait until the bourgeoisie chokes therevolution rodzianko is a man of action who has faithfully andtruthfully served the bourgeoisie for years half the lieberdansare cowardly compromisers half of them simple fatalists were getting stronger every day we shall be able to enter theconstituent assembly as a strong opposition then why should we playeverything on one cardanswer this is the argument of a sophomore with no practicalexperience who reads that the constituent assembly is being calledand trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way even thevoting of the constituent assembly will not do away with hunger orbeat wilhelm the issue of hunger and of surrendering petrogradcannot be decided by waiting for the constituent assembly hunger isnot waiting the peasants revolution is not waiting the admiralswho ran away did not waitblind people are surprised that hungry people betrayed by admiralsand generals do not take an interest in voting if the kornilovtsi make an attempt we would show them ourstrength but why should we risk everything by making an attemptourselvesanswer history doesnt repeat perhaps kornilov will some day makean attempt what a serious base for proletarian action but supposekornilov waits for starvation for the opening of the fronts whatthen this attitude means to build the tactics of a revolutionaryparty on one of the bourgeoisies former mistakeslet us forget everything except that there is no way out but by thedictatorship of the proletariateither that or the dictatorship ofkornilovlet us wait comrades fora miracle miliukovs speech resumevery one admits it seems that the defence of the country is ourprincipal task and that to assure it we must have discipline inthe army and order in the rear to achieve this there must be apower capable of daring not only by persuasion but also by forcethe germ of all our evils comes from the point of view originaltruly russian concerning foreign policy which passes for theinternationalist point of viewthe noble lenin only imitates the noble keroyevsky when he holdsthat from russia will come the new world which shall resuscitate theaged west and which will replace the old banner of doctrinarysocialism by the new direct action of starving massesand that willpush humanity forward and force it to break in the doors of thesocial paradisethese men sincerely believed that the decomposition of russia wouldbring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist rgimestarting from that point of view they were able to commit theunconscious treason in wartime of calmly telling the soldiers toabandon the trenches and instead of fighting the external enemycreating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors andcapitalistshere miliukov was interrupted by furious cries from the leftdemanding what socialist had ever advised such actionmartov says that only the revolutionary pressure of the proletariatcan condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist cliques andbreak down the dictatorship of these cliques not by an accordbetween governments for a limitation of armaments but by thedisarming of these governments and the radical democratisation of themilitary systemhe attacked martov viciously and then turned on the mensheviki andsocialist revolutionaries whom he accused of entering the governmentas ministers with the avowed purpose of carrying on the classstrugglethe socialists of germany and of the allied countries contemplatedthese gentlemen with illconcealed contempt but they decided that itwas for russia and sent us some apostles of the universalconflagrationthe formula of our democracy is very simple no foreign policy noart of diplomacy an immediate democratic peace a declaration to theallies we want nothing we havent anything to fight with andthen our adversaries will make the same declaration and thebrotherhood of peoples will be accomplishedmiliukov took a fling at the zimmerwald manifesto and declared thateven kerensky has not been able to escape the influence of thatunhappy document which will forever be your indictment he thenattacked skobeliev whose position in foreign assemblies where hewould appear as a russian delegate yet opposed to the foreign policyof his government would be so strange that people would say whatsthat gentleman carrying and what shall we talk to him about as forthe nakaz miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist that hebelieved in the creation of an international arbitration board andthe necessity for a limitation of armaments and parliamentarycontrol over secret diplomacy which did not mean the abolition ofsecret diplomacyas for the socialist ideas in the nakaz which he called stockholmideaspeace without victory the right of selfdetermination ofpeoples and renunciation of the economic warthe german successes are directly proportionate to the successes ofthose who call themselves the revolutionary democracy i do not wishto say to the successes of the revolution because i believe thatthe defeats of the revolutionary democracy are victories for therevolutionthe influence of the soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant onehad only to listen to the speech of the minister of foreign affairsto be convinced that in this hall the influence of therevolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so strong that theminister does not dare to speak face to face with it about the honourand dignity of russiawe can see in the nakaz of the soviets that the ideas of thestockholm manifesto have been elaborated in two directionthat ofutopianism and that of german interestsinterrupted by the angry cries of the left and rebuked by thepresident miliukov insisted that the proposition of peace concludedby popular assemblies not by diplomats and the proposal toundertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had renouncedannexations were progerman recently kuhlman said that a personaldeclaration bound only him who made it anyway we will imitate thegermans before we will imitate the soviet of workers and soldiersdeputiesthe sections treating of the independence of lithuania and livoniawere symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of russiasupported said miliukov by german money amid bedlam from theleft he contrasted the clauses of the nakaz concerningalsacelorraine rumania and serbia with those treating of thenationalities in germany and austria the nakaz embraced the germanand austrian point of view said miliukovpassing to terestchenkos speech he contemptuously accused him ofbeing afraid to speak the thought in his mind and even afraid tothink in terms of the greatness of russia the dardanelles mustbelong to russiayou are continually saying that the soldier does not know why he isfighting and that when he does know hell fight it is true thatthe soldier doesnt know why he is fighting but now you have toldhim that there is no reason for him to fight that we have nonational interests and that we are fighting for alien endspaying tribute to the allies who he said with the assistance ofamerica will yet save the cause of humanity he endedlong live the light of humanity the advanced democracies of thewest who for a long time have been travelling the way we now onlybegin to enter with illassured and hesitating steps long live ourbrave allies interview with kerenskythe associated press man tried his hand mr kerensky he beganin england and france people are disappointed with the revolutionyes i know interrupted kerensky quizzically abroad therevolution is no longer fashionablewhat is your explanation of why the russians have stopped fightingthat is a foolish question to ask kerensky was annoyed russiaentered the war first of all the allies and for a long time she borethe whole brunt of it her losses have been inconceivably greaterthan those of all the other nations put together russia has now theright to demand of the allies that they bring greater force of armsto bear he stopped for a moment and stared at his interlocutoryou are asking why the russians have stopped fighting and therussians are asking where is the british fleetwith germanbattleships in the gulf of riga again he ceased suddenly and assuddenly burst out the russian revolution hasnt failed and therevolutionary army hasnt failed it is not the revolution whichcaused disorganisation in the armythat disorganisation wasaccomplished years ago by the old regime why arent the russiansfighting i will tell you because the masses of the people areeconomically exhaustedand because they are disillusioned with thealliesthe interview of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the unitedstates and in a few days sent back by the american state departmentwith a demand that it be altered this kerensky refused to do butit was done by his secretary dr david soskiceand thus purged ofall offensive references to the allies was given to the press of theworld appendix to chapter iii resolution of the factoryshop committees workers control see ppage the organisation of workers control is a manifestation of thesame healthy activity in the sphere of industrial production as areparty organisations in the sphere of politics trade unions inemployment cooperatives in the domain of consumption and literaryclubs in the sphere of culture the workingclass has much more interest in the proper anduninterrupted operation of factories than the capitalist classworkers control is a better security in this respect for theinterests of modern society of the whole people than the arbitrarywill of the owners who are guided only by their selfish desire formaterial profits or political privileges therefore workers controlis demanded by the proletariat not only in their own interest but inthe interest of the whole country and should be supported by therevolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary army considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the capitalistclass toward the revolution experience shows that properdistribution of raw materials and fuel as well as the most efficientmanagement of factories is impossible without workers control only workers control over capitalist enterprises cultivating theworkers conscious attitude toward work and making clear its socialmeaning can create conditions favourable to the development of afirm selfdiscipline in labour and the development of all labourspossible productivity the impending transformation of industry from a war to a peacebasis and the redistribution of labour all over the country as wellas among the different factories can be accomplished without greatdisturbances only by means of the democratic selfgovernment of theworkers themselves therefore the realisation of workers control isan indispensable preliminary to the demobilisation of industry in accordance with the slogan proclaimed by the russian socialdemocratic labour party bolsheviki workers control on a nationalscale in order to bring results must extend to all capitalistconcerns and not be organised accidentally without system it mustbe wellplanned and not separated from the industrial life of thecountry as a whole the economic life of the countryagriculture industry commerceand transportmust be subjected to one unified plan constructed soas to satisfy the individual and social requirements of the widemasses of the people it must be approved by their electedrepresentatives and carried out under the direction of theserepresentatives by means of national and local organisations that part of the plan which deals with landlabour must be carriedout under supervision of the peasants and landworkersorganisations that relating to industry trade and transportoperated by wageearners by means of workers control the naturalorgans of workers control inside the industrial plant will be thefactoryshop and similar committees and in the labour market thetrade unions the collective wage agreements arranged by the trade unions forthe majority of workers in any branch of labour must be binding onall the owners of plants employing this kind of labour in the givendistrict employment bureaus must be placed under the control andmanagement of the trade unions as class organisations acting withinthe limits of the whole industrial plan and in accordance with it trade unions must have the right upon their own initiative tobegin legal action against all employers who violate labour contractsor labour legislation and also in behalf of any individual worker inany branch of labour on all questions relating to workers control over productiondistribution and employment the trade unions must confer with theworkers of individual establishments through their factoryshopcommittees matters of employment and discharge vacations wage scalesrefusal of work degree of productivity and skill reasons forabrogating agreements disputes with the administration and similarproblems of the internal life of the factory must be settledexclusively according to the findings of the factoryshop committeewhich has the right to exclude from participation in the discussionany members of the factory administration the factoryshop committee forms a commission to control thesupplying of the factory with raw materials fuel orders labourpower and technical staff including equipment and all othersupplies and arrangements and also to assure the factorys adherenceto the general industrial plan the factory administration is obligedto surrender to the organs of workers control for their aid andinformation all data concerning the business to make it possible toverify this data and to produce the books of the company upon demandof the factoryshop committee any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered bythe factoryshop committees or any suspicion of such illegal actswhich cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone shallbe referred to the district central organisation of factoryshopcommittees charged with the particular branch of labour involvedwhich shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with theexecution of the general industrial plan and find means to deal withthe matter even to the extent of confiscating the factory the union of the factoryshop committees of different concernsmust be accomplished on the basis of the different trades in orderto facilitate control over the whole branch of industry so as tocome within the general industrial plan and so as to create aneffective plan of distribution among the different factories oforders raw materials fuel technical and labour power and also tofacilitate cooperation with the trade unions which are organised bytrades the central city councils of trade unions and factoryshopcommittees represent the proletariat in the corresponding provincialand local institutions formed to elaborate and carry out the generalindustrial plan and to organise economic relations between the townsand the villages workers and peasants they also possess finalauthority for the management of factoryshop committees and tradeunions so far as workers control in their district is concernedand they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning workersdiscipline in the routine of productionwhich regulations howevermust be approved by vote of the workers themselves the bourgeois press on the bolshevikirusskaya volia october the decisive moment approaches it isdecisive for the bolsheviki either they will give us a secondedition of the events of july or they will have to admit thatwith their plans and intentions with their impertinent policy ofwishing to separate themselves from everything consciously nationalthey have been definitely defeatedwhat are the chances of bolshevik successit is difficult to answer that question for their principal supportis the ignorance of the popular masses they speculate on it theywork upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stopthe government must play its part in this affair supporting itselfmorally by the council of the republic the government must take aclearlydefined attitude toward the bolshevikiand if the bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against the legalpower and thus facilitate the german invasion they must be treatedas mutineers and traitorsbirzhevya viedomosti october now that the bolsheviki haveseparated themselves from the rest of the democracy the struggleagainst them is very much simplerand it is not reasonable in orderto fight against bolshevism to wait until they make a manifestationthe government should not even allow the manifestationthe appeals of the bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are actspunishable by the criminal courts and in the freest countries theirauthors would receive severe sentences for what the bolsheviki arecarrying on is not a political struggle against the government oreven for the power it is propaganda for anarchy massacres andcivil war this propaganda must be extirpated at its roots it

bywilliam patten managing editor of the harvard classicsintroduction by charles w eliot lld president emeritus of harvarduniversitywith a reading guide by william allan neilson ph d professor ofenglish harvard university president smith college northamptonmass since volume onefairy and wonder talesintroductionthe purpose of the junior classics is to provide in ten volumescontaining about five thousand pages a classified collection of talesstories and poems both ancient and modern suitable for boys andgirls of from six to sixteen years of age thoughtful parents andteachers who realize the evils of indiscriminate reading on the partof children will appreciate the educational value of such acollection a childs taste in reading is formed as a rule in thefirst ten or twelve years of its life and experience has shown thatthe childish mind will prefer good literature to any other if accessto it is made easy and will develop far better on literature of provedmerit than on trivial or transitory materialthe boy or girl who becomes familiar with the charming tales and poemsin this collection will have gained a knowledge of literature andhistory that will be of high value in other school and home work hereare the real elements of imaginative narration poetry and ethicswhich should enter into the education of every englishspeaking childthis collection carefully used by parents and teachers with duereference to individual tastes and needs will make many children enjoygood literature it will inspire them with a love of good readingwhich is the best possible result of any elementary education thechild himself should be encouraged to make his own selections from thislarge and varied collection the childs enjoyment being the object inview a real and lasting interest in literature or in scholarship isonly to be developed through the individuals enjoyment of his mentaloccupationsthe most important change which has been made in american schools andcolleges within my memory is the substitution of leading for drivingof inspiration for drill of personal interest and love of work forcompulsion and fear the schools are learning to use methods andmaterials which interest and attract the children themselves thejunior classics will put into the home the means of using this happymethodcommitting to memory beautiful pieces of literature either prose orpoetry for recitation before a friendly audience acting charades orplays and reading aloud with vivacity and sympathetic emotion aregood means of instruction at home or at school this collection containsnumerous admirable pieces of literature for such use in teachingenglish and english literature we should place more reliance uponprocesses and acts which awaken emotion stimulate interest prove tobe enjoyable for the actors and result in giving children the power ofentertaining people of blessing others with noble pleasures which thechildren create and sharefrom the home training during childhood there should result in thechild a taste for interesting and improving reading which will directand inspire its subsequent intellectual life the training whichresults in this taste for good reading however unsystematic oreccentric it may have been has achieved one principal aim ofeducation and any school or home training which does not result inimplanting this permanent taste has failed in a very important respectguided and animated by this impulse to acquire knowledge and exercisethe imagination through good reading the adult will continue toeducate him all through lifethe story of the human race through all its slow development should begradually conveyed to the childs mind from the time he begins to reador to listen to his mother reading and with description of facts andactual events should be mingled charming and uplifting products of theimagination to try to feed the minds of children upon facts alone isundesirable and unwise the immense product of the imagination in artand literature is a concrete fact with which every educated human beingshould be made somewhat familiar that product being a very real partof every individuals actual environmentthe right selection of reading matter for children is obviously of highimportance some of the mythologies old testament stories fairytales and historical romances on which earlier generations wereaccustomed to feed the childish mind contain a great deal that isbarbarous perverse or cruel and to this infiltration into childrensminds generation after generation of immoral cruel or foolish ideasis probably to be attributed in part the slow ethical progress of therace the commonest justification of this thoughtless practice is thatchildren do not apprehend the evil in the bad mental pictures withwhich we foolishly supply them but what should we think of a motherwho gave her children dirty milk or porridge on the theory that thechildren would not assimilate the dirt should we be less carefulabout mental and moral food materials the junior classics have beenselected with this principle in mind without losing sight of the factthat every developing human being needs to have a vision of the roughand thorny road over which the human race has been slowly advancingduring thousands of yearswhoever has committed to memory in childhood such bible extracts asgenesis i the ten commandments psalm xxiii matthew v thelords prayer and i corinthians xiii such english prose as lincolnsgettysburg speech bacons essay on truth and such poems as bryantswaterfowl addisons divine ode miltons sonnet on

can get along without but theexperience of many thousand years has shown us that the fairy tale isnot one of them there must have been fairy tales or fables or folktales or myths or whatever name we choose to give them ever sincethe world began they are not exclusively french german greekrussian indian or chinese but are the common property of the wholehuman family and are as universal as human speechall the world over fairy tales are found to be pretty much the samethe story of cinderella is found in all countries japan has a rip vanwinkle china has a beauty and the beast egypt has a puss in bootsand persia has a jack and the beanstalkthose wise people who have made a careful study of literature andespecially of what we call folk tales or fairy tales or fables ormyths tell us that they all typify in some way the constant strugglethat is going on in every department of life it may be the struggleof summer against winter the bright day against dark night innocenceagainst cruelty of knowledge against ignorance we are not obliged tothink of these delightful stories as each having a meaning ourenjoyment of them will not be less if we overlook that side but it mayhelp us to understand and appreciate good books if we remember that theliterature of the world is the story of mans struggle against naturethat the beginnings of literature came out of the mouths of storytellers and that the stories they told were fairy talesimaginativestories based on truththere is one important fact to remember in connection with the oldfairy tales and that is that they were repeated aloud from memory notread from a book or manuscriptthe printing of books from type may be said to date from the year when caxton introduced printing into england it is said that thefirst book printed in english which had the pages numbered was a bookof tales aesops fablesas late as printed books were still so rare that only rich mencould own them there was one other way of printing a storyonsheepskin split and made into parchment with a penbut that was along and laborious art that could only be practiced by educated men whohad been taught to write the monks were about the only men who hadthe necessary education and time and they cared more for making copiesof the bible and lives of the saints than they did of fairy tales thecommon people and even kings and queens were therefore obliged todepend upon the professional storytellerfairy tales were very popular in the middle ages in the long wintermonths fields could not be cultivated traveling had to be abandonedand all were kept within doors by the cold and snow we know what theknights house looked like in those days the large beamed hail orliving room was the principal room at one end of it on a lowplatform was a table for the knight his family and any visitingknights and ladies at the other tables on the main floor were thearmed men like squires and retainers who helped defend the castlefrom attack and the maids of the householdthe storyteller who was sometimes called a bard or skald or minstrelhad his place of honor in the center of the room and when the meal wasover he was called upon for a story these storytellers became veryexpert in the practice of their art and some of them could arousetheir audiences to a great pitch of excitement in the note thatprecedes the story the treason of ganelon in the

schoolcraftthere was never in the whole world a more mischievous busybody thanthat notorious giant manabozho he was everywhere in season and outof season running about and putting his hand in whatever was goingforwardto carry on his game he could take almost any shape he pleased hecould be very foolish or very wise very weak or very strong very richor very poorjust as happened to suit his humor best whatever anyoneelse could do he would attempt without a moments reflection he wasa match for any man he met and there were few manitoes goodspirits or evil spirits that could get the better of him by turns hewould be very kind or very cruel an animal or a bird a man or aspirit and yet in spite of all these gifts manabozho was alwaysgetting himself involved in all sorts of troubles more than once inthe course of his adventures was this great maker of mischief drivento his wits ends to come off with his lifeto begin at the beginning manabozho while yet a youngster was livingwith his grandmother near the edge of a great prairie it was on thisprairie that he first saw animals and birds of every kind he alsothere made first acquaintance with thunder and lightning he would sitby the hour watching the clouds as they rolled by musing on the shadesof light and darkness as the day rose and fellfor a stripling manabozho was uncommonly wideawake every sight hebeheld in the heavens was a subject of remark every new animal or birdan object of deep interest and every sound was like a new lesson whichhe was expected to learn he often trembled at what he heard and sawthe first sound he heard was that of the owl at which he was greatlyterrified and quickly descending the tree he had climbed he ran withalarm to the lodge noko noko grandmother he cried i haveheard a monedoshe laughed at his fears and asked him what kind of a noise it madehe answered it makes a noise like this kokokohohis grandmother told him he was young and foolish that what he heardwas only a bird which derived its name from the peculiar noise it madehe returned to the prairie and continued his watch as he stood therelooking at the clouds he thought to himself it is singular that i amso simple and my grandmother so wise and that i have neither fathernor mother i have never heard a word about them i must ask and findouthe went home and sat down silent and dejected finding that this didnot attract the notice of his grandmother he began a loud lamentationwhich he kept increasing louder and louder till it shook the lodgeand nearly deafened the old grandmothermanabozho what is the matter with you she said you are making agreat deal of noisemanabozho started off again with his doleful hubbub but succeeded injerking out between his big sobs i havent got any father nor motheri haventknowing that he was of a wicked and revengeful nature his grandmotherdreaded to tell him the story of his parentage as she knew he wouldmake trouble of itmanabozho renewed his cries and managed to throw out for a third orfourth time his sorrowful lament that he was a poor unfortunate whohad no parents or relativesat last she said to him to quiet him yes you have a father andthree brothers living your mother is dead she was taken for a wifeby your father the west without the consent of her parents yourbrothers are the north east and south and being older than you yourfather has given them great power with the winds according to theirnames you are the youngest of his children i have nursed you fromyour infancy for your mother died when you were borni am glad my father is living said manabozho i shall set out inthe morning to visit himhis grandmother would have discouraged him saying it was a longdistance to the place where his father ningabinn or the west livedthis information seemed rather to please than to discourage manabozhofor by this time he had grown to such a size and strength that he hadbeen compelled to leave the narrow shelter of his grandmothers lodgeand live out of doors he was so tall that if he had been sodisposed he could have snapped off the heads of the birds roosting onthe topmost branches of the highest trees as he stood up withoutbeing at the trouble to climb and if he had at any time taken a fancyto one of the same trees for a walking stick he would have had no moreto do than to pluck it up with his thumb and finger and strip down theleaves and twigs with the palm of his handbidding goodby to his old grandmother who pulled a very long faceover his departure manabozho set out at a great pace for he was ableto stride from one side of a prairie to the other at a single stephe found his father on a high mountain far in the west his fatherespied his approach at a great distance and bounded down themountainside several miles to give him welcome apparently delightedwith each other they reached in two or three of their giant paces thelodge of the west which stood high up near the cloudsthey spent some days in talking with each otherfor these two greatpersons did nothing on a small scale and a whole day to deliver asingle sentence such was the immensity of their discourse was quitean ordinary affairone evening manabozho asked his father what he was most afraid of onearthhe repliednothingbut is there nothing you dread herenothing that would hurt you if youtook too much of it come tell memanabozho was very urgent so at last his father said yes there is ablack stone to be found a couple of hundred miles from here over thatway pointing as he spoke it is the only thing on earth i am afraidof for if it should happen to hit me on any part of my body it wouldhurt me very much the west made this important circumstance known tomanabozho in the strictest confidencenow you will not tell anyone manabozho that the black stone is badmedicine for your father will you he added you are a good sonand i know you will keep it to yourself now tell me my darling boyis there not something that you dont likemanabozho answered promptlynothinghis father who was of a steady and persevering nature put the samequestion to him seventeen times and each time manabozho made the sameanswer nothingbut the west insistedthere must be something you are afraid ofwell i will tell you said manabozho what it ishe made an effort to speak but it seemed to be too much for himout with it said the west fetching manabozho such a blow on theback as shook the mountain with its echojeee jeeeit is said manabozho apparently in great pain yesyes i cannot name it i tremble sothe west told him to banish his fears and to speak up no one wouldhurt him manabozho began again and he would have gone over the samemakebelieve of pain had not his father whose strength he knew wasmore than a match for his own threatened to pitch him into a riverabout five miles off at last he cried outfather since you will know it is the root of the bulrush he whocould with perfect ease spin a sentence a whole day long seemed to beexhausted by the effort of pronouncing that one word bulrushsome time after manabozho observed i will get some of the black rockmerely to see how it lookswell said the father i will also get a little of the bulrush rootto learn how it tastesthey were both doubledealing with each other and in their heartsgetting ready for some desperate work they had no sooner separatedfor the evening than manabozho was striding off the couple of hundredmiles necessary to bring him to the place where the black rock was tobe procured while down the other side of the mountain hurriedningabinn the westat the break of day they each appeared at the great level on themountaintop manabozho with twenty loads at least of the blackstone on one side and on the other the west with a whole meadow ofbulrush in his armsmanabozho was the first to strikehurling a great piece of the blackrock which struck the west directly between the eyes and he returnedthe favor with a blow of bulrush that rung over the shoulders ofmanabozho far and wide like the long lash of the lightning among thecloudsfirst one and then the other manabozho poured in a tempest of blackrock while the west discharged a shower of bulrush blow upon blowthwack upon thwackthey fought hand to hand until black rock andbulrush were all gone then they betook themselves to hurling crags ateach other cudgeling with huge oak trees and defying each other fromone mountain top to another while at times they shot enormous bouldersof granite across at each others heads as though they had been merejackstones the battle which had commenced on the mountains hadextended far west the west was forced to give ground manabozhopressing on drove him across rivers and mountains ridges and lakestill at last he got him to the very brink of the worldhold cried the west my son you know my power and although iallow i am now fairly out of breath it is impossible to kill me stopwhere you are and i will also portion you out with as much power asyour brothers the four quarters of the globe are already occupiedbut you can go and do a great deal of good to the people of the earthwhich is beset with serpents beasts and monsters who make great havocof human life go and do good and if you put forth half the strengthyou have today you will acquire a name that will last forever whenyou have finished your work i will have a place provided for you youwill then go and sit with your brother kabinocca in the northmanabozho gave his father his hand upon this agreement and partingfrom him he returned to his own grounds where he lay for some timesore of his woundswhy the woodpecker has red head feathersadapted from h r schoolcraftwhen his wounds had all been cured by his grandmothers skill inmedicine manabozho as big and sturdy as ever was ripe for newadventures he set his thoughts immediately upon a war excursionagainst the pearl feather a wicked old manito living on the otherside of the great lake who had killed his grandfatherhe began his preparations by making huge bows and arrows withoutnumber but he had no arrow heads at last his grandmother noko toldhim that an old man who lived at some distance could furnish him withsome and he sent her to get them though she returned with herwrapper full he told her that he had not enough and sent her again formorein the meanwhile he thought to himself i must find out the way ofmaking these headsinstead of directly asking how it was done he preferredjust likemanabozhoto deceive his grandmother in order to learn what he wantedby a trick noko said he while i take my drum and rattle andsing my war songs do you go and try to get me some larger heads forthese you have brought me are all of the same size go and see whetherthe old man is not willing to make some a little largerhe followed her at a distance as she went having left his drum at thelodge with a great bird tied at the top whose fluttering wings shouldkeep up the drumbeat the same as if he were standing there beating thedrum himself he saw the old workman busy and learned how he preparedthe heads he also beheld the old mans daughter who was verybeautiful manabozho discovered for the first time that he had a heartof his own and the sigh he heaved passed through the arrow makerslodge like a young gale of windmy how it blows said the old manit must be from the south though said the daughter it is sofragrantmanabozho slipped away and in two strides he was at home shoutingforth his songs as though he had never left the lodge he had justtime to untie the bird which had been beating the drum when hisgrandmother came in and gave him the big arrowheadsin the evening the grandmother said my son you ought to fast beforeyou go to war as your brothers do to find out whether you will besuccessful or nothe said he had no objection having privately stored away in a shadyplace in the forest two or three dozen juicy bears a moose and twentystrings of the tenderest birds he would retire from the lodge so faras to be entirely out of view of his grandmother and fall to and enjoyhimself heartily at nightfall having dispatched a dozen birds andhalf a bear or so he would return tottering and forlorn as if quitefamished so as to make his grandmother feel sorry for himwhen he had finished his term of fasting in the course of which heslyly dispatched twenty fat bears six dozen birds and two fine moosemanabozho sung his war song and embarked in his canoe fully preparedfor warbesides his weapons he took along a large supply of oilhe traveled rapidly night and day for he had only to will or speakand the canoe went at length he arrived in sight of the fieryserpents and stopped to study them he noticed that they were ofenormous length and of a bright color that they were some distanceapart and that the flames which poured forth from the mouths reachedacross the pass so he said good morning and began talking with them ina very friendly way they were not to be deceived howeverwe know you manabozho they said you cannot passturning his canoe as if about to go back he suddenly cried out with aloud and terrified voice what is that behind youthe serpents thrown off their guard instantly turned their heads andin a moment manabozho glided silently past themwell said he softly after he had got by how about ithe then took up his bow and arrows and with deliberate aim shot everyone of them easily for the serpents were fixed to one spot and couldnot even turn aroundhaving thus escaped the sentinel serpents manabozho pushed on in hiscanoe until he came to a part of the lake called pitchwater aswhatever touched it was sure to stick fastbut manabozho was prepared with his oil and rubbing his canoe freelywith it from end to end he slipped through with easeand he was thefirst person who had ever succeeded in passing through the pitchwaternothing like a little oil said manabozho to himselfhaving by this time come in view of land he could see the lodge of theshining manito high upon a distant hill at the dawn of day he puthis clubs and arrows in order and began his attack yelling andshouting and beating his drum and calling out so as to make it appearthat he had many followerssurround him surround him run up run uphe stalked bravely forward shouting aloud it was you that killed mygrandfather and shot off a whole forest of arrowsthe pearl feather appeared on the height blazing like the sun andpaid back manabozho with a tempest of bolts which rattled like hailall day long the fight was kept up and manabozho had fired all of hisarrows but three without effect for the shining manito was clothed inpure wampum it was only by immense leaps to right and left thatmanabozho could save his head from the sturdy blows which fell abouthim on every side like pinetrees from the hands of the manito hewas badly bruised and at his very wits end when a large woodpeckerflew past and lit on a tree it was a bird he had known on theprairie near his grandmothers lodgemanabozho called out the woodpecker your enemy has a weak pointshoot at the lock of hair on the crown of his headthe first arrow he shot only drew a few drops of blood the manitomade one or two unsteady steps but recovered himself he began toparley but manabozho now that he had discovered a way to reach himwas in no humor to trifle and he let slip another arrow which broughtthe shining manito to his knees having the crown of his head withingood range manabozho shot his third arrow and the manito fell forwardupon the ground deadmanabozho called the woodpecker to come and receive a reward for thetimely hint he had given him and he rubbed the blood of the shiningmanito on the woodpeckers head the feathers of which are red to thisdayfull of his victory manabozho returned home beating his war drumfuriously and shouting aloud his song of triumph his grandmother wason the shore to welcome him with the war dance which she performedwith wonderful skill for one so far advanced in yearswhy the diver duck has so few tail feathersadapted from h r schoolcrafthaving overcome the powerful pearl feather killed his serpents andescaped all is wiles and charms the heart of manabozho welled withinhim an unconquerable desire for further adventures seized upon himhe had won in a great fight on land so he determined his next successshould come to him from the waterhe tried his luck as a fisherman and with such success that he capturedan enormous fish a fish so rich in fat that with the oil manabozhowas able to form a small lake wishing to be generous and at thesame time having a cunning plan of his own he invited all the birdsand beasts of his acquaintance to come and feast upon the oil tellingthem that the order in which they partook of the banquet would decidehow fat each was to be for all time to comeas fast as they arrived he told them to plunge in and help themselvesthe first to make his appearance was the bear who took a long andsteady draft then came the deer the opossum and such others of thefamily as are noted for their comfortable covering the moose and thebuffalo were late in arriving on the scene and the partridge alwayslean in flesh looked on till the supply was nearly gone there wasnot a drop left by the time the hare and the marten appeared on theshore of the lake and they are in consequence the slenderest of allcreatureswhen this ceremony was over manabozho suggested to his friends theassembled birds and animals that the occasion was proper for a littlemerrymaking and taking up his drum he cried outnew songs from the south come brothers dancethey all fell in and commenced their rounds whenever manabozho as hestood in the circle saw a fat fowl which he fancied pass him headroitly wrung its neck and slipped it under his belt at the same timebeating his drum and singing at the top of his lungs to drown the noiseof the fluttering crying out in a tone of admirationthats the way my brothers thats the way at last a small duck ofthe diver family thinking there was something wrong opened one eyeand saw what manabozho was doing giving a spring and crying hahaa manabozho is killing us he made a dash for the watermanabozho was so angry that the creature should have played the spythat he gave chase and just as the diver duck was getting into thewater he gave him a kick which is the reason that the divers tailfeathers are few his back flattened and his legs straightened out sothat when he is seen walking on land he makes a sorry looking figurethe other birds having no ambition to be thrust in manabozhos beltflew off and the animals scampered into the woodsmanaibozho is changed into awolfadapted from h r schoolcraftone evening as manabozho was walking along the shore of a great lakeweary and hungry he met a great magician in the form of an old wolfwith six young ones coming toward himthe wolf no sooner caught sight of him than he told his whelps whowere close beside him to keep out of the way of manabozho for iknow he said that it is that mischievous fellow whom we seeyonderthe young wolves were in the act of running off when manabozho criedout my grandchildren where are you going stop and i will go withyou i wish to have a little chat with your excellent fathersaying which he advanced and greeted the old wolf expressing himselfas delighted at seeing him looking so well whither do you journeyhe askedwe are looking for a good huntingground to pass the winter the oldwolf answered what brings you herei was looking for you said manabozho for i have a passion for thechase brother i always admired your family are you willing tochange me into a wolfthe wolf gave him a favorable answer and he was forthwith changed intoa wolfwell that will do said manabozho but he said looking at histail could you oblige me by making my tail a little longer and morebushy just a little more bushycertainly said the old wolf and he straightway gave manabozho sucha length and spread of tail that it was continually getting between hislegs and it was so heavy that it was as much as he could do to carryit but having asked for it he was ashamed to say a word and theyall started off in company dashing up the ravineafter getting into the woods for some distance they ran across thetracks of moose the young ones scampered off in pursuit the old wolfand manabozho following at their leisurewell said the old wolf by way of starting the conversation who doyou think is the fastest of the boys can you tell by the jumps theytakewhy he replied that one that takes such long jumps he is surelythe fastestha ha you are mistaken said the old wolf he makes a good startbut he will be the first to tire out this one who appears to be behindwill be the one to kill the gameby this time they had come to the spot where the boys had started inchase one had dropped what seemed to be a small medicinesack whichhe carried for the use of the hunting partytake that manabozho said the old wolfwhy what will i do with a dirty dog skinthe old wolf took it up it was a beautiful robeoh i will carry it now cried manabozhooh no said the wolf who had used his magical powers it is a robeof pearls come along and away he sped at a great rate of speednot so fast called manabozho after him and then he added to himselfas he panted after oh this tailcoming to a place where the moose had lain down they saw that theyoung wolves had made a fresh start after their prey why said theold wolf this moose is thin i know by the tracks i can alwaystell whether they are fat or not a little farther on one of theyoung wolves in dashing at the moose had broken a tooth on a treemanabozho said the old wolf one of your grandchildren has shot atthe game take his arrow there it isno replied manabozho what will i do with a dirty dogs tooththe old wolf took it up and behold it was a beautiful silver arrowwhen they at last overtook them they found that the youngsters hadkilled a very fat moose manabozho was very hungry but the old wolfjust then again exerted his magical powers and manabozho saw nothingbut the bones picked quite clean he thought to himself just as iexpected dirty greedy fellows if it had not been for this log at myback i should have been in time to have got a mouthful and he cursedthe bushy tail which he carried to the bottom of his heartthe old wolf finally called out to one of the young ones give somemeat to your grandfatherone of them obeyed and coming near to manabozho he presented him theend of his own bushy tail which was now nicely seasoned with bursgathered in the course of the hunt manabozho jumped up and calledout you dog do you think i am going to eat you and he walked offin angercome back brother cried the wolf you are losing your eyes youdo the child injustice look there i and behold a heap of fresh meatwas lying on the spot all preparedmanabozho turned back and at the sight of so much good food put on asmiling face wonderful he said how fine the meat is yes replied the old wolf it is always so with us we know our workand always get the best it is not a long tail that makes the huntermanabozho bit his lipmanabozho is robbed by the wolvesadapted from h r schoolcraftshortly after this the old wolf suggested to manabozho that he shouldgo out and try his luck in hunting by himself when he chose to puthis mind to it he was quite expert and this time he succeeded inkilling a fine fat moose which he thought he would take aside slyly anddevour alonehe was very hungry and he sat down to eat but as he never could go towork in a straightforward way he immediately fell into great doubts asto the proper point at which to beginwell said he i do not know where to commence at the head nopeople will laugh and say he ate him backwardhe went to the side no said he they will say i ate himsidewayshe then went to the hind quarter no that will not do either theywill say i ate him forward i will begin here say what they willhe took a delicate piece from the small of the back and was just onthe point of putting it to his mouth when a tree close by made acreaking noise he seemed vexed at the sound he raised the morsel tohis mouth the second time when the tree creaked againwhy he exclaimed i cannot eat when i hear such a noise stopstop he cried to the tree he put down the morsel of meatexclaiming i cannot eat with such a noise and starting away heclimbed the tree and was actually pulling at the limb which hadbothered him when his forepaw was caught between the branches so thathe could not free himselfwhile thus held fast he saw a pack of wolves advancing through the woodin the direction of his meat he suspected them to be the old wolf andhis cubs but night was coming on and he could not make them out gothe other way go the other way he cried out what do you expect toget herethe wolves stopped for a while and talked among themselves and saidmanabozho must have something there or he would not tell us to goanother way i begin to know know him said the old wolf and all his trickslet us go forward and see they came on and finding the moose soonmade away with itmanabozho looked wistfully on while they ate until they were fullysatisfied when off they scampered in high spirits a heavy blast ofwind opened the branches finally and released him the wolves hadleft nothing but bare bones he made for homewhen he related his mishap the old wolf taking him by the forepawcondoled with him deeply on his ill luck a tear even started to hiseye as he added my brother this should teach us not to meddle withpoints of ceremony when we have good meat to eatmanabozho and the woodpeckersadapted from h r schoolcraftmanabozho lost the greater part of his magical power through lettinghis young wolf grandson fall through the thin ice and drown no oneknew where his grandmother had gone to he married the arrow makersdaughter and became the father of several children but he was verypoor and scarcely able to procure a living his lodge was pitched in adistant part of the country where he could get no game and it waswinter time one day he said to his wife i will go out walking andsee if i can find some lodgesafter walking some time he finally discovered a lodge at a distancethere were children playing at the door and when they saw himapproaching they ran in and told their parents manabozho was comingit was the home of the large redheaded woodpecker he came to thedoor and asked manabozho to enter and the invitation was promptlyaccepted after some time the woodpecker who was a magician said tohis wife have you nothing to give manabozho he must be hungryshe answered nohe ought not to go without his supper said the woodpecker i willsee what i can doin the center of the lodge stood a large tamarack tree upon this thewoodpecker flew and commenced going up turning his head on each sideof the tree and every now and then driving in his bill at last hepulled something out of the tree and threw it down when behold afine fat raccoon lay on the ground he drew out six or seven more andthen came down and told his wife to prepare themmanabozho he said this is the only thing we eat what else can wegive youit is very good replied manabozhothey smoked their pipes and conversed and after a while manabozho gotready to go home so the woodpecker said to his wife give him theother raccoons to take home for his childrenin the act of leaving the lodge manabozho on purpose dropped one of hismittens which was soon after observed upon the ground run saidthe woodpecker to his eldest son and give it to him but mind thatyou do not give it into his hand throw it at him for there is

thinks he has got poor fellow he was bound howeverto answer the offer of hospitality and he went accordingly takingalong a cedarsack to pay a visit to manabozhomanabozho received the old redheaded woodpecker with great ceremonyhe had stood at the door awaiting his arrival and as soon as he camein sight manabozho commenced while he was yet far off bowing andopening wide his arms in token of welcome all of which the woodpeckerreturned in due form by ducking his bill and hopping to right andleft extending his wings to their full length and fluttering them backto his breastwhen the woodpecker at last reached the lodge manabozho made severalremarks upon the weather the appearance of the country and especiallyspoke of the scarcity of game but we he addedwe always haveenough come in and you shall not go away hungry my noble birdsmanabozho had always prided himself on being able to give as good as hehad received and to be up with the woodpecker he had shifted his lodgeso as to inclose a large dry tamarack treewhat can i give you said he to the woodpecker as we eat so shallyou eatwith this he hopped forward and jumping on the tamarack tree heattempted to climb it just as he had seen the woodpecker do in his ownlodge he turned his head first on one side and then on the other asthe woodpecker does striving to go up the tree but as often slippingdown every now and then he would strike the tree with his nose as ifit was a bell and draw back as if to pull something out of the treebut he pulled out no raccoons he dashed his nose so often against thetrunk that at last the blood began to flow and he tumbled downsenseless on the groundthe woodpecker started up with his drum and rattle to restore him andby beating them violently he succeeded in bringing him toas soon as he came to his senses manabozho began to lay the blame ofhis failure upon his wife saying to his guest nemesho it is thiswoman relation of yoursshe is the cause of my not succeeding she hasmade me a worthless fellow before i married her i also could getraccoonsthe woodpecker said nothing but flying on the tree he drew out severalfine raccoons here said he this is the way we do and left himin

fathers youthwas spenttherefore he opened all his heart to his sister who answered mybrother i understand your longing for our fellowmen whom here wecannot see but remember our fathers words shall we not seek ourown pleasures and forget the little onebut he would not listen and making no reply he took his bow andarrows and left the hut the snows fell and melted yet he neverreturned and at last the heart of the girl grew cold and hard and herlittle boy became a burden in her eyes till one day she spoke thus tohim see there is food for many days to come stay here within theshelter of the hut i go to seek our brother and when i have foundhim i shall return hitherbut when after hard journeying she reached the village where herbrother dwelt and saw that he had a wife and was happy and when shetoo was sought by a young brave then she also forgot the boy alone inthe forest and thought only of her husbandnow as soon as the little boy had eaten all the food which his sisterhad left him he went out into the woods and gathered berries and dugup roots and while the sun shone he was contented and had his fillbut when the snows began and the wind howled then his stomach feltempty and his limbs cold and he hid in trees all the night and onlycrept out to eat what the wolves had left behind and by and byhaving no other friends he sought their company and sat by while theydevoured their prey and they grew to know him and gave him food andwithout them he would have died in the snow but at last the snowsmelted and the ice upon the great lake and as the wolves went down tothe shore the boy went after them and it happened one day that hisbig brother was fishing in his canoe near the shore and he heard thevoice of a child singing in the indian tonemy brother my brotheri am becoming a wolfi am becoming a wolfand when he had so sung he howled as wolves howl then the heart ofthe elder sank and he hastened toward him crying brother littlebrother come to me but he being half a wolf only continued hissong and the louder the elder called him brother little brothercome to me the swifter he fled after his brothers the wolves and theheavier grew his skin till with a long howl he vanished into thedepths of the forestso with shame and anguish in his soul the elder brother went back tohis village and with his sister mourned the little boy and the brokenpromise till the end of his lifethe indian who lost his wiferetold by andrew langonce upon a time there was a man and his wife who lived in the forestfar from the rest of the tribe very often they spent the day inhunting together but after awhile the wife found that she had so manythings to do that she was obliged to stay at home so he went alonethough he found that when his wife was not with him he never had anyluck one day when he was away hunting the woman fell ill and in afew days she died her husband grieved bitterly and buried her in thehouse where she had passed her life but as the time went on he felt solonely without her that he made a wooden doll about her height amidsize for company and dressed it in her clothes he seated it in frontof the fire and tried to think he had his wife back again the nextday he went out to hunt and when he came home the first thing he didwas to go up to the doll and brush off some of the ashes from the firewhich had fallen on its face but he was very busy now for he had tocook and mend besides getting food for there was no one to help himand so a whole year passed awayat the end of that time he came back from hunting one night and foundsome wood by the door and a fire within the next night there was notonly wood and fire but a piece of meat in the kettle nearly ready foreating he searched all about to see who could have done this butcould find no one the next time he went to hunt he took care not togo far and came in quite early and while he was still a long way offhe saw a woman going into the house with wood on her shoulders so hemade haste and opened the door quickly and instead of the wooden dollhis wife sat in front of the fire then she spoke to him and saidthe great spirit felt sorry for you because you would not becomforted so he let me come back to you but you must not stretch outyour hand to touch me till we have seen the rest of our people if youdo i shall dieso the man listened to her words and the woman dwelt there and broughtthe wood and kindled the fire till one day her husband said to herit is now two years since you died let us now go back to our tribethen you will be well and i can touch youand with that he prepared food for the journey a string of deersflesh for her to carry and one for himself and so they started nowthe camp of the tribe was distant six days journey and when they wereyet one days journey off it began to snow and they felt weary andlonged for rest therefore they made a fire cooked some food andspread out their skins to sleepthen the heart of the man was greatly stirred and he stretched out hisarms to his wife but she waved her hands and saidwe have seen no one yet it is too soonbut he would not listen to her and caught her to him and behold hewas clasping the wooden doll and when he saw it was the doll hepushed it from him in his misery and rushed away to the camp and toldthem all his story and some doubted and they went back with him tothe place where he and his wife had stopped to rest and there lay thedoll and besides they saw in time snow the steps of two people andthe foot of one was like the foot of the doll and the man grievedsore all the days of his lifepunchkinby e frereonce upon a time there was a raja who had seven beautiful daughtersthey were all good girls but the youngest named balna was moreclever than the rest the rajas wife died when they were quite littlechildren so these seven poor princesses were left with no mother totake care of themthe rajas daughters took it by turns to cook their fathers dinnerevery day while he was absent deliberating with his ministers on theaffairs of the nationabout this time the prudhan died leaving a widow and one daughter andevery day when the seven princesses were preparing their fathersdinner the prudhans widow and daughter would come and beg for alittle fire from the hearth then balna used to say to her sisterssend that woman away send her away let her get the fire at her ownhouse what does she want with ours if we allow her to come here weshall suffer for it some daybut the other sisters would answer be quiet balna why must youalways be quarreling with this poor woman let her take some fire ifshe likes then the prudhans widow used to go to the hearth and takea few sticks from it and while no one was looking she would quicklythrow some mud into the midst of the dishes which were being preparedfor the rajas dinnernow the raja was very fond of his daughters ever since their mothersdeath they had cooked his dinner with their own hands in order toavoid the danger of his being poisoned by his enemies so when hefound the mud mixed up with his dinner he thought it must arise fromtheir carelessness as it did not seem likely that anyone should haveput mud there on purpose but being very kind he did not like toreprove them for it although this spoiling of the curry was repeatedmany daysat last one day he determined to hide and watch his daughterscooking and see how it all happened so he went into the next roomand watched them through a hole in the wallthere he saw his seven daughters carefully washing the rice andpreparing the curry and as each dish was completed they put it by thefire ready to be cooked next he noticed the prudhans widow come tothe door and beg for a few sticks from the fire to cook her dinnerwith balna turned to her angrily and said why dont you keep fuelin your own house and not come here every day and take ours sistersdont give this woman any more wood let her buy it for herselfthen the eldest sister answered balna let the poor woman take thewood and the fire she does us no harm but balna replied if youlet her come here so often maybe she will do us some harm and make ussorry for it some daythe raja then saw the prudhans widow go to the place where all hisdinner was nicely prepared and as she took the wood she threw alittle mud into each of the dishesat this he was very angry and sent to have the woman seized andbrought before him but when the widow came she told him that she hadplayed this trick because she wanted to gain an audience with him andshe spoke so cleverly and pleased him so well with her cunning wordsthat instead of punishing her the raja married her and made her hisranee and she and her daughter came to live in the palacenow the new ranee hated the seven poor princesses and wanted to getthem if possible out of the way in order that her daughter mighthave all their riches and live in the palace as princess in theirplace and instead of being grateful to them for their kindness to hershe did all she could to make them miserable she gave them nothingbut bread to eat and very little of that and very little water todrink so these seven poor little princesses who had been accustomedto have everything comfortable about them and good food and goodclothes all their lives long were very miserable and unhappy and theyused to go out every day and sit by their dead mothers tomb and cryand sayo mother mother cannot you see your poor children how unhappy weare and how we are starved by our cruel stepmotherone day while they were thus sobbing and crying lo and behold abeautiful pomelo tree grew up out of the grave covered with freshripe pomeloes and the children satisfied their hunger by eating someof the fruit and every day after this instead of trying to eat thebad dinner their stepmother provided for them they used to go out totheir mothers grave and eat the pommels which grew there on thebeautiful treethen the ranee said to her daughter i cannot tell how it is everyday those seven girls say they dont want any dinner and wont eatany and yet they never grow thin nor look ill they look better thanyou do i cannot tell how it is and she bade her watch the sevenprincesses and see if anyone gave them anything to eatso next day when the princesses went to their mothers grave and wereeating the beautiful pomeloes the prudhans daughter followed themand saw them gathering the fruitthen balna said to her sisters do you not see that girl watching uslet us drive her away or hide the pomeloes else she will go and tellher mother all about it and that will be bad for usbut the other sisters said oh no do not be unkind balna the girlwould never be so cruel as to tell her mother let us rather inviteher to come and have some of the fruit and calling her to them theygave her one of the pomeloesno sooner had she eaten it however than the prudhans daughter wenthome and said to her mother i do not wonder the seven princesses willnot eat the dinner you prepare for them for by their mothers gravethere grows a beautiful pomelo tree and they go there every day andeat the pomeloes i ate one and it was the nicest i have evertastedthe cruel ranee was much vexed at hearing this and all next day shestayed in her room and told the raja that she had a very bad headachethe raja was deeply grieved and said to his wife what can i do foryou she answered there is only one thing that will make myheadache well by your dead wifes tomb there grows a fine pomelotree you must bring that here and boil it root and branch and put alittle of the water in which it has been boiled on my forehead andthat will cure my headache so the raja sent his servants and hadthe beautiful pomelo tree pulled up by the roots and did as the raneedesired and when some of the water in which it had been boiled wasput on her forehead she said her headache was gone and she felt quitewellnext day when the seven princesses went as usual to the grave of theirmother the pomelo tree had disappeared then they all began to cryvery bitterlynow there was by the ranees tomb a small tank and as they were cryingthey saw the tank was filled with a rich creamlike substance whichquickly hardened into a thick white cake at seeing this all theprincesses were very glad and they ate some of the cake and liked itand next day the same thing happened and so it went on for many daysevery morning the princesses went to their mothers grave and foundthe little tank filled with the nourishing creamlike cake then thecruel stepmother said to her daughter i cannot tell how it is i havehad the pomelo tree which used to grow by the ranees grave destroyedand yet the princesses grow no thinner nor look more sad though theynever eat the dinner i give them i cannot tell how it isand her daughter said i will watchnext day while the princesses were eating the cream cake who shouldcome by but their stepmothers daughter balna saw her first andsaid see sisters there comes that girl again let us sit round theedge of the tank and not allow her to see it for if we give her someof our cake she will go and tell her mother and that will be veryunfortunate for usthe other sisters however thought balna unnecessarily suspicious andinstead of following her advice they gave the prudhans daughter someof the cake and she went home and told her mother all about itthe ranee on hearing how well the princesses fared was exceedinglyangry and sent her servants to pull down the dead ranees tomb andfill the little tank with the ruins and not content with this shenext day pretended to be very very illin fact at the point of deathand when the raja was much grieved and asked her whether it was in hispower to procure her any remedy she said to him only one thing cansave my life but i know you will not do it he replied yeswhatever it is i will do it she then said to save my life youmust kill the seven daughters of your first wife and put some of theirblood on my forehead and on the palms of my hands and their death willbe my life at these words the raja was very sorrowful but becausehe feared to break his word he went out with a heavy heart to find hisdaughtershe found them crying by the ruins of their mothers gravethen feeling he could not kill them the raja spoke kindly to themand told them to come out into the jungle with him and there he made afire and cooked some rice and gave it to them but in the afternoonit being very hot the seven princesses all fell asleep and when hesaw they were fast asleep the raja their father stole away and leftthem for he feared his wife saying to himself it is better my poordaughters should die here than be killed by their stepmotherhe then shot a deer and returning home put some of its blood on theforehead and hands of the ranee and she thought then that he hadreally killed the princesses and said she felt quite wellmeantime the seven princesses awoke and when they found themselves allalone in the thick jungle they were much frightened and began to callout as loud as they could in hopes of making their father hear but hewas by that time far away and would not have been able to hear themeven had their voices been as loud as thunderit so happened that this very day the seven young sons of a neighboringraja chanced to be hunting in that same jungle and as they werereturning home after the days sport was over the youngest princesaid to his brothers stop i think i hear some one crying and callingout do you not hear voices let us go in the direction of the soundand find out what it isso the seven princes rode through the wood until they came to the placewhere the seven princesses sat crying and wringing their hands at thesight of them the young princes were very much astonished and stillmore so on learning their story and they settled that each should takeone of these poor forlorn ladies home with him and marry herso the first and eldest prince took the eldest princess home with himand married herand the second took the second and third took the third and thefourth took the fourth and the fifth took the fifth and the sixthtook the sixth and the seventh and the handsomest of all took thebeautiful balnaand when they got to their own land there was great rejoicingthroughout the kingdom at the marriage of the seven young princes toseven such beautiful princessesabout a year after this balna had a little son and his uncles andaunts were so fond of the boy that it was as if he had seven fathersand seven mothers none of the other princes and princesses had anychildren so the son of the seventh prince and balna was acknowledgedtheir heir by all the restthey had thus lived very happily for some time when one fine day theseventh prince balnas husband said he would go out hunting and awayhe went and they waited long for him but he never came backthen his six brothers said they would go and see what had become ofhim and they went away but they also did not returnand the seven princesses grieved very much for they feared that theirkind husbands must have been killedone day not long after this had happened as balna was rocking herbabys cradle and while her sisters were working in the room belowthere came to the palace door a man in a long black dress who saidthat he was a fakir and came to beg the servant said to him youcannot go into the palacethe rajas sons have all gone away we thinkthey must be dead and their widows cannot be interrupted by yourbegging but he said i am a holy man you must let me in then thestupid servants let him walk through the palace but they did not knowthat this was no fakir but a wicked magician named punchkinpunchkin fakir wandered through the palace and saw many beautifulthings there till at last he reached the room where balna sat singingbeside her little boys cradle the magician thought her morebeautiful than all the other beautiful things he had seen insomuchthat he asked her to go home with him and to marry him but she saidmy husband i fear is dead but my little boy is still quite young iwill stay here and teach him to grow up a clever man and when he isgrown up he shall go out into the world and try and learn tidings ofhis father heaven forbid that i should ever leave him or marry yonat these words the magician was very angry and turned her into alittle black dog and led her away saying since yon will not comewith me of your own free will i will make you so the poor princesswas dragged away without any power of effecting an escape or ofletting her sisters know what had become of her as punchkin passedthrough the palace gate the servants said to him where did yon getthat pretty little dog and he answered one of the princesses gaveit to me as a present at hearing which they let him go withoutfurther questioningsoon after this the six elder princesses heard the little baby theirnephew begin to cry and when they went upstairs they were muchsurprised to find him all alone and balna nowhere to be seen thenthey questioned the servants and when they heard of the fakir and thelittle black dog they guessed what had happened and sent in everydirection seeking them but neither the fakir nor the dog were to befound what could six poor women do they gave up all hopes of everseeing their kind husbands and their sister and her husband againand devoted themselves thenceforward to teaching and taking care oftheir little nephewthus time went on till balnas son was fourteen years old then oneday his aunts told him the history of the family and no sooner did hehear it than be was seized with a great desire to go in search of hisfather and mother and uncles and if he could find them alive to bringthem home again his aunts on learning his determination were muchalarmed and tried to dissuade him saying we have lost our husbandsand our sister and her husband and you are now our sole hope if yougo away what shall we do but he replied i pray you not to bediscouraged i will return soon and if it is possible bring my fatherand mother and uncles with me so he set out on his travels but forsome months he could learn nothing to help him in his searchat last after he had journeyed many hundreds of weary miles andbecome almost hopeless of ever hearing anything further of his parentshe one day came to a country that seemed full of stones and rocks andtrees and there he saw a large palace with a tower hard by was amalees little houseas he was looking about the malees wife saw him and ran out of thehouse and said my dear boy who are you that dare venture to thisdangerous place he answered i am a rajas son and i come insearch of my father and my uncles and my mother whom a wickedenchanter bewitchedthen the malees wife said this country and this palace belong to agreat enchanter he is all powerful and if anyone displeases him hecan turn them into stones and trees all the rocks and trees you seehere were living people once and the magician turned them to what theynow are some time ago a rajas son came here and shortly afterwardcame his six brothers and they were all turned into stones and treesand these are not the only unfortunate ones for up in that tower livesa beautiful princess whom the magician has kept prisoner there fortwelve years because she hates him and will not marry himthen the little prince thought these must be my parents and myuncles i have found what i seek at last so he told his story tothe malees wife and begged her to help him to remain in that placeawhile and inquire further concerning the unhappy people she mentionedand she promised to befriend him and advised his disguising himselflest the magician should see him and turn him likewise into stone tothis the prince agreed so the malees wife dressed him up in a sareeand pretended that he was her daughterone day not long after this as the magician was walking in his gardenhe saw the little girl as he thought playing about and asked her whoshe was she told him she was the malees daughter and the magiciansaid you are a pretty little girl and tomorrow you shall take apresent of flowers from me to the beautiful lady who lives in thetowerthe young prince was much delighted at hearing this and wentimmediately to inform the malees wife after consultation with whom hedetermined that it would be more safe for him to retain his disguiseand trust to the chance of a favorable opportunity for establishingsome communication with his mother if it were indeed shenow it happened that at balnas marriage her husband had given her asmall gold ring on which her name was engraved and she had put it onher little sons finger when he was a baby and afterward when he wasolder his aunts had had it enlarged for him so that he was still ableto wear it the malees wife advised him to fasten the wellknowntreasure to one of the bouquets he presented to his mother and trustto her recognizing it this was not to be done without difficulty assuch a strict watch was kept over the poor princess for fear of herever establishing communication with her friends that though thesupposed malees daughter was permitted to take her flowers every daythe magician or one of his slaves was always in the room at the timeat last one day however opportunity favored him and when no one waslooking the boy tied the ring to a nosegay and threw it at balnasfeet it fell with a clang on the floor and balna looking to seewhat made the strange sound found the little ring tied to the flowerson recognizing it she at once believed the story her son told her ofhis long search and begged him to advise her as to what she had betterdo at the same time entreating him on no account to endanger his lifeby trying to rescue her she told him that for twelve long years themagician had kept her shut up in the tower because she refused to marryhim and she was so closely guarded that she saw no hope of releasenow balnas son was a bright clever boy so he said do not feardear mother the first thing to do is to discover how far themagicians power extends in order that we may be able to liberate myfather and uncles whom he has imprisoned in the form of the rocks andtrees you have spoken to him angrily for twelve long years nowrather speak kindly tell him you have given up all hopes of againseeing the husband you have so long mourned and say you are willing toharry him then endeavor to find out what his power consists in andwhether he is immortal or can be put to deathbalna determined to take her sons advice and the next day sent forpunchkin and spoke to him as had been suggestedthe magician greatly delighted begged her to allow the wedding to takeplace as soon as possiblebut she told him that before she married him he must allow her a littlemore time in which she might make his acquaintance and that afterbeing enemies so long their friendship could but strengthen bydegrees and do tell me she said are you quite immortal candeath never touch you and are you too great an enchanter ever to feelhuman sufferingwhy do you ask said hebecause she replied if i am to be your wife i would fain knowall about you in order if any calamity threatens you to overcome orif possible to avert itit is true he added that i am not as others far far awayhundreds of thousands of miles from this there lies a desolate countrycovered with thick jungle in the midst of the jungle grows a circleof palm trees and in the center of the circle stand six chattees fullof water piled one above another below the sixth chattee is a smallcage which contains a little green parrot on the life of the parrotdepends my life and if the parrot is killed i must die it ishowever he added impossible that the parrot should sustain anyinjury both on account of the inaccessibility of the country andbecause by my appointment many thousand genii surround the palmtrees and kill all who approach the placebalna told her son what punchkin had said but at the same timeimplored him to give up all idea of getting the parrotthe prince however replied mother unless i can get hold of thatparrot you and my father and uncles cannot be liberated be notafraid i will shortly return do you meantime keep the magician ingood humorstill putting off your marriage with him on variouspretexts and before he finds out the cause of delay i will be hereso saying he went awaymany many weary miles did he travel till at last he came to a thickjungle and being very tired sat down under a tree and fell asleephe was awakened by a soft rustling sound and looking about him saw alarge serpent which was making its way to an eagles nest built in thetree under which he lay and in the nest were two young eagles theprince seeing the danger of the young birds drew his sword and killedthe serpent at the same moment a rushing sound was heard in the airand the two old eagles who had been out hunting for food for theiryoung ones returned they quickly saw the dead serpent and the youngprince standing over it and the old mother eagle said to him dearboy for many years all our young ones have been devoured by thatcruel serpent you have now saved the lives of our children wheneveryou are in need therefore send to us and we will help you and as forthese little eagles take them and let them be your servantsat this the prince was very glad and the two eaglets crossed theirwings on which he mounted and they carried him far far away over thethick jungles until he came to the place where grew the circle ofpalm trees in the midst of which stood the six chattees full of waterit was the middle of the day and the heat was very great all roundthe trees were the genii fast asleep nevertheless there were suchcountless thousands of them that it would have been quite impossiblefor anyone to walk through their ranks to the place down swooped thestrongwinged eagletsdown jumped the prince in an instant he hadoverthrown the six chattees full of water and seized the little greenparrot which he rolled up in his cloak while as he mounted againinto the air all the genii below awoke and finding their treasuregone set up a wild and melancholy howlaway away flew the little eagles till they came to their home in thegreat tree then the prince said to the old eagles take back yourlittle ones they have done me good service if ever again i stand inneed of help i will not fail to come to you he then continued hisjourney on foot till he arrived once more at the magicians palacewhere he sat down at the door and began playing with the parrotpunchkin saw him and came to him quickly and said my boy where didyon get that parrot give it to me i pray youbut the prince answered oh no i cannot give away my parrot it is agreat pet of mine i have had it many yearsthen the magician said if it is an old favorite i can understandyour not caring to give it away but come what will you sell it forsir said the prince i will not sell my parrotthen punchkin got frightened and said anything anything name whatprice you will and it shall be yours the prince answered let theseven rajas sons whom you turned into rocks and trees be instantlyliberatedit is done as you desire said the magician only give me myparrot and with that by a stroke of his wand balnas husband andhis brothers resumed their natural shapes now give me my parrotrepeated punchkinnot so fast my master rejoined the prince i must first beg thatyou will restore to life all whom you have thus imprisonedthe magician immediately waved his

certain fisherwoman passed by a palace crying her fish the queenappeared at one of the windows and beckoned her to come near and showwhat she had at that moment a very big fish jumped about in thebottom of the basketis it a he or a she inquired the queen i wish to purchase a shefishon hearing this the fish laughed aloudits a he replied the fisherwoman and proceeded on her roundsthe queen returned to her room in a great rage and on coming to seeher in the evening the king noticed that something had disturbed herare you indisposed he saidno but i am very much annoyed at the strange behavior of a fish awoman brought me one today and on my inquiring whether it was a maleor female the fish laughed most rudelya fish laugh impossible you must be dreamingi am not a fool i speak of what i have seen with my own eyes andheard with my own earspassing strange be it so i will inquire concerning iton the morrow the king repeated to his vizier what his wife had toldhim and bade him investigate the matter and be ready with asatisfactory answer within six mouths on pain of death the vizierpromised to do his best though he felt almost certain of failure forlive months he labored indefatigably to find a reason for the laughterof the fish he sought everywhere and from everyone the wise andlearned and they who were skilled in magic and in all manner oftrickery were consulted nobody however could explain the matterand so he returned brokenhearted to his house and began to arrangehis affairs in prospect of certain death for he had had sufficientexperience of the king to know that his majesty would not go back fromhis threat amongst other things he advised his son to travel for atime until the kings anger should have somewhat cooledthe young fellow who was both clever and handsome started offwhithersoever kismet might lead him he had been gone some days whenhe fell in with an old farmer who also was on a journey to a certainvillage finding the old man very pleasant he asked him if he mightaccompany him professing to be on a visit to the same place the oldfarmer agreed and they walked along together the day was hot andthe way was long and wearydont yon think it would be pleasanter if you and i sometimes gave oneanother a lift said the youthwhat a fool the man is thought the old farmerpresently they passed through a field of corn ready for the sickle andlooking like a sea of gold as it waved to and fro in the breezeis this eaten or not said the young mannot understanding his meaning the old man replied i dont knowafter a little while the two travelers arrived at a big village wherethe young man gave his companion a clasp knife and said take thisfriend and get two horses with it but mind and bring it back for itis very preciousthe old man looking half amused and half angry pushed back the knifemuttering something to the effect that his friend was either a foolhimself or else tying to play the fool with him the young manpretended not to notice his reply and remained almost silent till theyreached the city a short distance outside which was the old farmershousethey walked about the bazaar and went to the mosque but nobody salutedthem or invited them to come in and restwhat a large cemetery exclaimed the young manwhat does the man mean thought the old farmer calling this largelypopulated city a cemeteryon leaving the city their way led through a cemetery where a few peoplewere praying beside a grave and distributing chupatties and kulchas topassersby in the name of their beloved dead they beckoned to thetwo travelers and gave them as much as they wouldwhat a splendid city this is said the young mannow the man must surely be demented thought the old farmer iwonder what he will do next he will be calling the land water andthe water land and be speaking of light where there is darkness andof darkness where it is light however he kept his thoughts tohimselfpresently they had to wade through a stream that ran along the edge ofthe cemetery the water was rather deep so the old farmer took offhis shoes and pajamas and crossed over but the young man waded throughit with his shoes and pajamas onwell i never did see such a perfect fool both in word and in deedsaid the old man to himselfhowever he liked the fellow and thinking that he would amuse his wifeand daughter he invited him to come and stay at his house as long ashe had occasion to remain in the villagethank you very much the young man replied but let me firstinquire if you please whether the beam of your house is strong the old farmer left him in despair and entered his house laughingthere is a man in yonder field he said after returning theirgreetings he has come the greater part of the way with me and iwanted him to put up here as long as he had to stay in this villagebut the fellow is such a fool that i cannot make anything out of himhe wants to know if the beam of this house is all right the man mustbe mad and saying this he burst into a fit of laughterfather said the farmers daughter who was a very sharp and wisegirl this man whosoever he is is no fool as you deem him he onlywishes to know if you can afford to entertain himoh of course replied the farmer i see well perhaps you canhelp me to solve some of his other mysteries while we were walkingtogether he asked whether he should carry me or i should carry him ashe thought that would be a pleasanter mode of proceedingmost assuredly said the girl he meant that one of you should tella story to beguile the timeoh yes well we were passing through a cornfield when he asked mewhether it was eaten or notand didnt you know the meaning of this father he simply wished toknow if the man was in debt or not because if the owner of the fieldwas in debt then the produce of the field was as good as eaten to himthat is it would have to go to his creditorsyes yes yes of course then on entering a certain village hebade me take his clasp knife and get two horses with it and bring backthe knife again to himare not two stout sticks as good as two horses for helping one alongon the road he only asked you to cut a couple of sticks and becareful not to lose his knifei see said time farmer while we were walking over the city we didnot see anybody that we knew and not a soul gave us a scrap ofanything to eat till we were passing the cemetery but there somepeople called to us and put into our hands some chupatties and kulchasso my companion called the city a cemetery and the cemetery a citythis also is to be understood father if one thinks of the city asthe place where everything is to be obtained and of inhospitablepeople as worse than the dead the city though crowded with peoplewas as if dead as far as you were concerned while in the cemeterywhich is crowded with time dead you were saluted by kind friends andprovided with breadtrue true said the astonished farmer then just now when wewere crossing the stream he waded through it without taking off hisshoes and pajamasi admire his wisdom replied time girl i have often thought howstupid people were to venture into that swiftly flowing stream and overthose sharp stones with bare feet the slightest stumble and theywould fall and be wetted from head to foot this friend of yours is amost wise man i should like to see him and speak to himvery well said time farmer i will go and find him and bring himintell him father that our beams are strong enough and then he willcome in ill send on ahead a present to the man to show him that wecan afford to have him for our guestaccordingly she called a servant and sent him to the young man with apresent of a basin of ghee twelve chupatties and a jar of milk andthe following message o friend time moon is full twelve months makea year and the sea is overflowing with waterhalfway the bearer of this present and message met his little sonwho seeing what was in the basket begged his father to give him someof the food his father foolishly complied presently he saw theyoung man and gave him the rest of the present and the messagegive your mistress my salaam he replied and tell her that the moonis new and that i can only find eleven mouths in the year and the seais by no means fullnot understanding the meaning of these words the servant repeated themword for word as he had heard them to his mistress and thus histheft was discovered and he was severely punished after a littlewhile the young man appeared with the old farmer great attention wasshown to him and he was treated in every way as it he were the son ofa great man although his humble host knew nothing of his origin atlength be told them everythingabout the laughing of the fish hisfathers threatened execution and his own banishmentand asked theiradvice as to what he should dothe laughing of the fish said the girl which seems to have beenthe cause of all this trouble indicates that there is a man in thepalace who is plotting against the kings lifejoy joy exclaimed the viziers son there is yet time for me toreturn and save my father from an ignominious and unjust death and theking from dangerthe following day he hastened back to his own country taking with himthe farmers

married the oldfarmers daughter and a most happy marriage it wasthe farmer and the money lenderby joseph jacobsthere was ounce a farmer who suffered much at time hands of the moneylender good harvests or bad the farmer was always poor the moneylender rich at the last when he hadnt a farthing left the farmerwent to the money lenders house and said you cant squeeze waterfrom a stone and as you have nothing to get by me now you might tellme the secret of becoming richmy friend returned the money lender piously riches come from ramask himthank you i will replied the simple farmer so he prepared threegriddle cakes to last him on the journey and set out to find ramfirst he met a brahman and to him he gave a cake asking him to pointout the road to ram but the brahman only took the cake and went on hisway without a word next the farmer met a jogi or devotee and to himhe gave a cake without receiving any help in return at last he cameupon a poor man sitting under a tree and finding out he was hungrythe kindly farmer gave him his last cake and sitting clown to restbeside him entered into conversationand where are you going asked the poor man at lengthoh i have a long journey before me for i am going to find ramreplied the farmer i dont suppose you could tell me which way togoperhaps i can said the poor man smiling for i am ram what do youwant of methen the farmer told the whole story and rain taking pity on himgave him a conch shell and showed him how to blow it in a particularway saying remember whatever you wish for you have only to blowthe conch that way and your wish will be fulfilled only have a careof that money lender for even magic is not proof against their wilesthe farmer went back to his village rejoicing in fact the moneylender noticed his high spirits at once and said to himself somegood fortune must have befallen the stupid fellow to make him hold hishead so jauntily therefore he went over to the simple farmershouse and congratulated him on his good fortune in such cunningwords pretending to have heard all about it that before long thefarmer found himself telling the whole storyall except the secret ofblowing the conch for with all his simplicity the farmer was notquite such a fool as to tell thatnevertheless the money lender determined to have the conch by hook orby crook and as he was villain enough not to stick at trifles hewaited for a favorable opportunity and stole the conchbut after nearly bursting himself with blowing the conch in everyconceivable way he was obliged to give up the secret as a bad jobhowever being determined to succeed he went back to the farmer andsaid coolly look here ive got your conch but i cant use it youhavent got it so its clear you cant use it either business is ata standstill unless we make a bargain now i promise to give you backyour conch and never to interfere with your using it on onecondition which is thiswhatever you get from it i am to get doublenever cried the farmer that would be the old business all overagainnot at all replied time wily money lender you will have yourshare now dont be a dog in the manger for if you get all you wantwhat can it matter to you if i am rich or poorat last though it went sorely against the grain to be of any benefitto a money lender the farmer was forced to yield and from that timeno matter what he gained by the power of the couch time money lendergained double and the knowledge that this was so preyed upon thefarmers mind day and night so that he had no satisfaction out ofanythingat last there came a very dry seasonso dry that the farmers cropswithered for want of rain then he blew his conch and wished for awell to water them and lo there was the well but the money lenderhad twotwo beautiful new wells this was too much for any farmer tostand and our friend brooded over it and brooded over it till atlast a bright idea came into his head he seized the conch blew itloudly and cried out oh ram i wish to be blind of one eye andso he was in a twinkling but the money lender of course was blind ofboth and in trying to steer his way between the two new wells he fellinto one and was drownednow this true story shows that a farmer once got time better of a moneylenderbut only by losing one of his eyespride goeth before a fallby joseph jacobsin a certain village there lived ten cloth merchants who always wentabout together once upon a time they had traveled far afield andwere returning home with a great deal of money which they had obtainedby selling their wares now there happened to be a dense forest neartheir village and this they reached early one morning in it therelived three notorious robbers of whose existence the traders had neverheard and while they were still in the middle of it the robbers stoodbefore them with swords and cudgels in their hands and ordered themto lay down all they had the traders had no weapons with them andso though they were many more in number they had to submit themselvesto the robbers who took away everything from them even the veryclothes they wore and gave to each only a small loin cloth a span inbreadth and a cubit in lengththe idea that they had conquered ten men and plundered all theirproperty now took possession of the robbers minds they seatedthemselves like three monarchs before the men they had plundered andordered them to dance to them before returning home the merchants nowmourned their fatethey had lost all they had except their loin cloth and still therobbers were not satisfied but ordered them to dancethere was among the ten merchants one who was very clever hepondered over the calamity that had come upon him and his friends thedance they would have to perform and the magnificent manner in whichthe three robbers had seated themselves on the grass at the same timehe observed that these last had placed their weapons on the ground inthe assurance of having thoroughly cowed the traders who were nowcommencing to dance so he took the lead in the dance and as a songis always sung by the leader on such occasions to which the rest keeptime with hands and feet he thus began to singwe are enty menthey are erith menif each erith mansurround eno meneno man remainsta tai tom tadinganathe robbers were all uneducated and thought that the leader was merelysinging a song as usual so it was in one sense for the leadercommenced from a distance and had sung the song over twice before heand his companions commenced to approach the robbers they hadunderstood his meaning because they had been trained in tradewhen two traders discuss the price of an article in the presence of apurchaser they use a riddling sort of languagewhat is the price of this cloth one trader will ask anotherenty rupees another will reply meaning ten rupeesthus there is no possibility of the purchaser knowing what is meantunless he be acquainted with trade language by the rules of thissecret language erith means three enty means ten and eno meansone so the leader by his song meant to hint to his fellowtradersthat they were ten men the robbers only three that if three pouncedupon each of the robbers nine of them could hold them down while theremaining one bound the robbers hands and feetthe three thieves glorying in their victory and little understandingthe meaning of the song and the intentions of the dancers were proudlyseated chewing betel and tobacco meanwhile the song was sung a thirdtime ta tai tom had left the lips of the singer and beforetadingana was out of them the traders separated into parties of threeand each party pounced upon a thief the remaining onethe leaderhimselftore up into long narrow strips a large piece of cloth sixcubits long and tied the hands and feet of the robbers these wereentirely humbled now and rolled on the ground like three bags of ricethe ten traders now took back all their property and armed themselveswith the swords and cudgels of their enemies and when they reachedtheir village they often amused their friends and relatives byrelating their adventurehow the wicked sons were dupedby joseph jacobsa very wealthy old man imagining that he was on the point of deathsent for his sons and divided his property among them however he didnot die for several years afterward and miserable years many of themwere besides the weariness of old age the old fellow had to bearwith much abuse and cruelty from his sons wretched selfish ingratespreviously they vied with one another in trying to please their fatherhoping thus to receive more money but now they had received theirpatrimony they cared not how soon he left themnay the sooner thebetter because he was only a needless trouble and expense and theylet the poor old man know what they feltone day he met a friend and related to him all his troubles thefriend sympathized very much with him and promised to think over thematter and call in a little while and tell him what to do he did soin a few days he visited the old man and put down four bags full ofstones and gravel before himlook here friend said he your sons will get to know of my cominghere today and will inquire about it you must pretend that i cameto discharge a longstanding debt with you and that you are severalthousands of rupees richer than you thought you were keep these bagsin your own hands and on no account let your sons get to them as longas you are alive you will soon find them change their conduct towardyou salaam i will come again soon to see how you are getting onwhen the young men got to hear of this further increase of wealth theybegan to be more attentive and pleasing to their father than everbefore and thus they continued to the day of the old mans demisewhen the bags were greedily opened and found to contain only stonesand gravelthe tiger the brahman and the jackalby flora annie steelonce upon a time a tiger was caught in a trap he tried in vain to getout through the bars and rolled and bit with rage and grief when hefailedby chance a poor brahman came bylet me out of this cage oh pious one cried the tigernay my friend replied the brahman mildly you would probably eat meif i didnot at all swore the tiger with many oaths on the contrary ishould be forever grateful and serve you as a slavenow when the tiger sobbed and sighed and wept and swore the piousbrahmans heart softened and at last he consented to open the door ofthe cage out popped the tiger and seizing the poor man criedwhat a fool you are what is to prevent my eating you now for afterbeing cooped up so long i am terribly hungryin vain the brahman pleaded for his life the most he could gain was apromise to abide by the decision of the first three things he chose toquestion as to the justice of the tigers actionso the brahman first asked a pipal tree what it thought of the matterbut the pipal tree replied coldly what have you to complain aboutdont i give shade and shelter to everyone who passes by and dontthey in return tear down my branches to feed their cattle dontwhimperbe a man then the brahman sad at heart went farther afield till he saw abuffalo turning a well wheel but he fared no better from it for itanswered you are a fool to expect gratitude look at me while igave milk they fed me on cottonseed and oil cake but now i am dry theyyoke me here and give me refuse as fodderthe brahman still more sad asked the road to give him its opinionmy dear sir said the road how foolish you are to expect anythingelse here am i useful to everybody yet all rich and poor greatand small trample on me as they go past giving me nothing but theashes of their pipes and the husks of their grainon this the brahman turned back sorrowfully and on the way he met ajackal who called out why whats the matter mr brahman you lookas miserable as a fish out of waterthe brahman told him all that had occurredhow very confusing said the jackal when the recital was endedwould you mind telling me over again for everything has got so mixedupthe brahman told it all over again but the jackal shook his head in adistracted sort of way and still could not understandits very odd said he sadly but it all seems to go in at one earand out at the other i will go to the place where it all happenedand then perhaps i shall be able to give a judgment so they returned to the cage by which the tiger was waiting for thebrahman and sharpening his teeth and clawsyouve been away a long time growled the savage beast but now letus begin our dinnerour dinner thought the wretched brahman as his knees knockedtogether with fright what a remarkably delicate way of putting itgive mime five minutes my lord he pleaded in order that i mayexplain matters to the jackal here who is somewhat slow in his witsthe tiger consented and the brahman began the whole story over againnot missing a single detail and spinning as long a yarn as possibleoh my poor brain oh my poor brain cried the jackal wringing itspaws let me see how did it all begin you were in the cage andthe tiger came walking bypooh interrupted the tiger what a fool you are i was in thecageof course cried the jackal pretending to tremble with fright yesi was in the cageno i wasntdear dear where are my wits let meseethe tiger was in the brahman and the cage came walking bynothats not it either well dont mind me but begin your dinner fori shall never understandyes you shall returned the tiger in a rage at the jackalsstupidity ill make you understand look herei am the tigeryes my lordand that is the brahmanyes my lordand that is the cageyes my lordand i was in the cagedo you understandyesno please my lordwell cried the tiger impatientlyplease my lord how did you get inhowwhy in the usual way of course oh dear memy head is beginning to whirl again please dont getangry my lord but what is the usual wayat this the tiger lost patience and jumping into the cage criedthis way now do you understand how it wasperfectly grinned the jackal as he dexterously shut the door andif you will permit me to say so i think matters will remain as theywerethe lambikinby flora annie steelonce upon a time there was a wee wee lambikin who frolicked about onhis little tottery legs and enjoyed himself amazinglynow one day he set off to visit his granny and was jumping with joy tothink of all the good things he should get from her when who should hemeet but a jackal who looked at the tender young morsel and saidlambikin lambikin ill eat youbut lambikin only gave a little frisk and saidto grannys house i gowhere i shall fatter growthen you can eat me sothe jackal thought this

all these when they saw the tender little morsel saidlambikin lambikin ill eat youbut to all of them lambikin replied with a little friskto grannys house i gowhere i shall fatter growthen you can eat me soat last he reached his grannys house and said all in a great hurrygranny dear ive promised to get very fat so as people ought tokeep their promises please put me into the corn bin at onceso his granny said he was a good boy and put him into the corn binand there the greedy little lambikin stayed for seven days and ateand ate and ate until he could scarcely waddle and his granny saidhe was

arid cried hullo youve turned yourself inside out have youjust you come out of thatwhereupon he tore open drumikin and gobbled up lambikinthe rats weddingby flora annie steelonce upon a time a fat sleek rat was caught in a shower of rain andbeing far from shelter he set to work and soon dug a nice hole in theground in which he sat as dry as a bone while the raindrops splashedoutside making little puddles on the roadnow in the course of digging he came upon a fine bit of root quitedry and fit for fuel which he set aside carefullyfor the rat is aneconomical creaturein order to take it home with him so when theshower was over he set off with the dry root in his mouth as he wentalong daintily picking his way through the puddles he saw a poor manvainly trying to light a fire while a little circle of children stoodby and cried piteouslygoodness gracious exclaimed the rat who was both softhearted andcurious what a dreadful noise to make what is the matterthe children are hungry answered the man they are crying for theirbreakfast but the sticks are damp the fire wont burn and so i cantbake the cakesif that is all your trouble perhaps i can help you said the goodnatured rat you are welcome to this dry root and ill warrant it willsoon make a fine blazethe poor man with a thousand thanks took the dry root and in histurn presented the rat with a morsel of dough as a reward for hiskindness and generositywhat a remarkably lucky fellow i am thought the rat as he trottedoff gayly with his prize and clever too fancy making a bargainlike thatfood enough to last me five days in return for a rotten oldstick wah wah wah what it is to have brainsgoing along hugging his good fortune in this way he came presently toa potters yard where the potter leaving his wheel to spin round byitself was trying to pacify his three little children who werescreaming arid crying as if they would burstmy gracious cried the rat stopping his ears what a noise dotell me what it is all abouti suppose they are hungry replied the potter ruefully their motherhas gone to get flour in the bazaar for there is none in the housein the meantime i can neither work nor rest because of themis that all answered the officious rat then i can help you takethis dough cook it quickly and stop their mouths with foodthe potter overwhelmed the rat with thanks for his obliging kindnessand choosing out a nice wellburned pipkin insisted on his acceptingit as a remembrancethe rat was delighted at the exchange and though the pipkin was just atrifle awkward for him to manage he succeeded after infinite troublein balancing it on his head and went away gingerly tinkatink tin katink down the road with his tail over his arm for fear he shouldtrip on it and all the time he kept saying to himself what a luckyfellow i am and clever too such a hand at a bargainby and by he came to where some cowherds were herding their cattleone of them was milking a buffalo and having no pail he used hisshoes insteadoh fie oh fie cried the cleanly rat quite shocked at the sightwhat a nasty dirty trick why dont you use a pailfor the best of all reasonswe havent got one growled the cowherdwho did not see why the rat should put his finger in the pieif that is all replied the dainty rat oblige me by using thispipkin for i cannot bear dirtthe cowherd nothing loath took the pipkin and milked away until itwas brimming over then turning to the rat who stood looking on saidhere little fellow you may have a drink in paymentbut if the rat was goodnatured he was also shrewd no no myfriend said he that will not do as if i could drink the worth ofany pipkin at a draft my dear sir i couldnt hold it besides inever make a bad bargain so i expect you at least to give me thebuffalo that gave the milknonsense cried the cowherd a buffalo for a pipkin whoever heardof such a price and what on earth could you do with a buffalo whenyou got it why the pipkin was about as much as you could manageat this the rat drew himself up with dignity for he did not likeallusions to his size that is my affair not yours he retortedyour business is to hand over the buffaloso just for the fun of the thing and to amuse themselves at the ratsexpense the cowherds loosened the buffalos halter and began to tie itto the little animals tailno no he called in a great hurry if the beast pulled the skinof my tail would come off and then where should i be tie it aroundmy neck if you pleaseso with much laughter the cowherds tied the halter round the ratsneck and he after a polite leavetaking set off gayly toward homewith his prize that is to say he set off with the rope for no soonerdid he come to the end of the tether than be was brought up with around turn the buffalo nose down grazing away would not budge untilit had finished its tuft of grass and then seeing another in adifferent direction marched off toward it while the rat to avoidbeing dragged had to trot humbly behind willynilly he was tooproud to confess the truth of course and nodding his head knowinglyto the cowherds said tata good people i am going home this wayit may be a little longer but its much shadierand when the cowherds roared with laughter he took no notice buttrotted on looking as dignified as possible after all he reasonedto himself when one keeps a buffalo one has to look after itsgrazing a beast must get a good bellyful of grass if it is to giveany milk and i have plenty of time at my disposal so all day longhe trotted about after the buffalo making believe but by evening hewas dead tired and felt truly thankful when the great big beasthaving eaten enough lay down under a tree to chew the cudjust then a bridal party came by the bridegroom and his friends hadevidently gone on to the next village leaving the brides palanquin tofollow so the palanquin bearers being lazy fellows and seeing a niceshady tree put down their burden and began to cook some foodwhat detestable meanness grumbled one a grand wedding and nothingbut plain rice to eat not a scrap of meat in it neither sweet norsalt it would serve the skinflints right if we upset the bride into aditchdear me cried the rat at once seeing a way out of his difficultythat is a shame i sympathize with your feelings so entirely that ifyou will allow me ill give you my buffalo you can kill it and cookityour buffalo returned the discontented bearers what rubbishwhoever heard of a rat owning a buffalonot often i admit replied the rat with conscious pride but lookfor yourselves can you not see that i am leading the beast by astringoh never mind the string cried a great big hungry bearer master orno master i mean to have meat for my dinner whereupon they killedthe buffalo and cooking its flesh ate their dinner with a relishthen offering the remains to the rat said carelessly here littleratskin that is for younow look here cried the rat hotly ill have none of your pottageor your sauce either you dont suppose i am going to give my bestbuffalo that gave quarts and quarts of milkthe buffalo i have beenfeeding all dayfor a wee bit of rice no i got a loaf for a bit ofstick i got a pipkin for a little loaf i got a buffalo for a pipkinand now ill have the bride for my buffalothe bride and nothingelseby this time the servants having satisfied their hunger began toreflect on what they had done and becoming alarmed at theconsequences arrived at the conclusion it would be wisest to maketheir escape while they could so leaving the bride in her palanquinthey took to their heels in various directionsthe rat being as it were left in possession advanced to thepalanquin and drawing aside the curtain with the sweetest of voicesand best of bows begged the bride to descend she hardly knew whetherto laugh or to cry but as any company even a rats was better thanbeing quite alone in the wilderness she did what she was bidden andfollowed the lead of her guide who set off as fast as be could for hisholeas he trotted along beside the lovely young bride who by her richdress and glittering jewels seemed to be some kings daughter he keptsaying to himself how clever i am what bargains i do make to besurewhen they arrived at his hole the rat stepped forward with thegreatest politeness and said welcome madam to my humble abodepray step in or if you will allow me and as the passage is somewhatdark i will show you the waywhereupon he ran in first but after a time finding the bride did notfollow he put his nose out again saying testily well madam whydont you follow dont you know its rude to keep your husbandwaitingmy good sir laughed the handsome young bride i cant squeeze intothat little holethe rat coughed then after a moments thought he replied there issome truth in your remark you are overgrown and i suppose i shallhave to build you a thatch somewhere for tonight you can rest underthat wild plum treebut i am so hungry said the bride ruefullydear dear everybody seems hungry today returned the ratpettishly however thats easily settledill fetch you some supperin a triceso he ran into his hole returning immediately with an ear of milletand a dry pea there said he triumphantly isnt that a finemeali cant eat that whimpered the bride it isnt a mouthful and iwant rice pottage and cakes and sweet eggs and sugar drops i shalldie if i dont get themoh dear me cried the rat in a rage what a nuisance a bride is tobe sure why dont you eat the wild plumsi cant live on wild plums retorted the weeping bride nobodycould besides they are only half ripe and i cant reach themrubbish cried the rat ripe or unripe they must do you for tonight and tomorrow you can gather a basketful sell them in the cityand buy sugar drops and sweet eggs to your hearts contentso the next morning the rat climbed up into the plum tree and nibbledaway at the stalks till the fruit fell down into the brides veilthen unripe as they were she carried them into the city calling outthrough the streetsgreen plums i sell green plums i sellprincess am i rats bride as wellas she passed by the palace her mother the queen heard her voiceand running out recognized her daughter great were the rejoicingsfor everyone thought the poor bride had been eaten by wild beastsin the midst of the feasting and merriment the rat who had followedthe princess at a distance and had become alarmed at her long absencearrived at the door against which he beat with a big knobby stickcalling out fiercely give me my wife give me my wife she is mineby a fair bargain i gave a stick and i got a loaf i gave a loaf

all about nothing who wants to run away withyour wife on the contrary we are proud to see you and i only keepyou waiting at the door till we can spread the carpets and receive youin stylehearing this the rat was mollified and waited patiently outside whilethe cunning old queen prepared for his reception which she did bycutting a hole in the very middle of a stool putting a red hot stoneunderneath covering it over with a stewpan lid and then spreading abeautiful embroidered cloth over all then she went to the door andreceiving the rat with the greatest respect led him to the stoolpraying him to be seateddear dear how clever i am what bargains i do make to be suresaid he to himself as he climbed on to the stool here i am soninlaw to a real live queen what will the neighbors sayat first he sat down on the edge of the stool but even there it waswarm and after a while he began to fidget saying dear me motherinlaw how hot your house is everything i touch seems burningyou are out of the wind there my son replied the cunning old queensit more in the middle of the stool and then you will feel the breezeand get coolerbut he didnt for the stewpan lid by this time had become so hot thatthe rat fairly frizzled when he sat down on it and it was not until hehad left all his tail half his hair and a large piece of his skinbehind him that he managed to escape howling with pain and vowingthat never never never again would he make a bargainthe jackal and the partridgeby flora annie steela jackal and a partridge swore eternal friendship but the jackal wasvery exacting and jealous you dont do half as much for me as i dofor you he used to say and yet you talk a great deal of yourfriendship now my idea of a friend is one who is able to make melaugh or cry give me a good meal or save my life if need be youcouldnt do thatlet us see answered the partridge follow me at a little distanceand if i dont make you laugh soon you may eat meso she flew on till she met two travelers trudging along one behindthe other they were both footsore and weary and the first carriedhis bundle on a stick over his shoulder while the second had his shoesin his handlightly as a feather the partridge settled on the first travelersstick he none the wiser trudged on but the second traveler seeingthe bird sitting so tamely just in front of his nose said to himselfwhat a chance for a supper and immediately

her friendwell answered the jackal you have certainly made nine laugh but idoubt if you could make me cry it is easy enough to be a buffoon itis more difficult to excite the highest emotionslet us see retorted the partridge somewhat piqued there is ahuntsman with his dogs coming along the road just creep into thathollow tree and watch me if you dont weep scalding tears you musthave no feeling in youthe jackal did as he was bid and watched the partridge who beganfluttering about the bushes till the dogs caught sight of her when sheflew to the hollow tree where the jackal was hidden of course thedogs smelt him at once and set up such a yelping and scratching thatthe huntsman came up and seeing what it was dragged the jackal out bythe tail whereupon the dogs worried him to their hearts content andfinally left him for deadby and by he opened his eyesfor he was only foxingand saw thepartridge sitting on a branch above himdid you cry she asked anxiously did i rouse your high emobe quiet will you snarled the jackal half dead with fearso there the jackal lay for some time getting the better of hisbruises and meanwhile he became hungrynow is the time for friendship said he to the partridge get me agood dinner and i will acknowledge you a true friendvery well replied the partridge only watch me and help yourselfwhen the time comesjust then a troop of women came by carrying their husbands dinners tothe harvest field the partridge gave a little plaintive cry andbegan fluttering along from bush to bush as if she were woundeda wounded bird a wounded bird cried the women we can easilycatch it whereupon they set off in pursuit but the cunningpartridge played a thousand tricks till they became so excited overthe chase that they put their bundles on the ground in order to pursueit more nimbly the jackal meanwhile seizing his opportunity creptup and made off with a good dinnerare you satisfied now asked the partridgewell returned the jackal i confess you have given me a

and the crocodile kindlyconsented to carry them across so they sat on his broad back and heferried them over but just as they were in the middle of the streamthe partridge remarked i believe the crocodile intends to play us atrick how awkward if he were to drop you into the waterawkward for you too replied the jackal turning palenot at all not at all i have wings you haventon this the jackal shivered and shook with fear and when thecrocodile in a gruesome growl remarked that he was hungry and wanteda good meal the wretched creature hadnt a word to saypooh cried the partridge airily dont try tricks on usi shouldfly away and as for my friend the jackal you couldnt hurt him heis not such a fool as to take his life with him on these littleexcursions he leaves it at home locked up in the

annie steelonce upon a time mr jackal was trotting along gayly when lie caughtsight of a wild plum tree laden with fruit on the other side of abroad deep stream i could not get across anyhow so he just sat downon the bank and looked at the ripe luscious fruit until his mouthwatered with desirenow it so happened that just then miss crocodile came floating downstream with her nose in the airgood morning my dear said mr jackal politely how beautiful youlook today and how charmingly you swim now if i could only swimtoo what a fine feast of plums we two friends might have over theretogether and mr jackal laid his paw on his heart and sighednow miss crocodile had a very inflammable heart and when mr jackallooked at her so admiringly and spoke so sentimentally she simperedand blushed saying oh mr jackal how can you talk so i couldnever dream of going out to dinner with you unlessunlessunless what asked the jackal persuasivelyunless we were going to be married simpered miss crocodileand why shouldnt we be married my charmer returned the jackaleagerly i would go and fetch the barber to begin the betrothal atonce but i am so faint with hunger just at present that i should neverreach the village now if the most adorable of her sex would onlytake pity on her slave and carry me over the stream i might refreshmyself with those plums and so gain strength to accomplish the ardentdesire of my hearthere the jackal sighed so piteously and cast such sheeps eyes at misscrocodile that she was unable to withstand him so she carried himacross to the plum tree and then sat on the waters edge to think overher wedding dress while mr jackal feasted on the plums and enjoyedhimselfnow for the barber my beauty cried the gay jackal when he hadeaten as much as he could then the blushing miss crocodile carriedhim back again and bade him be quick about his business like a deargood creature for really she felt so flustered at the very idea thatshe didnt know what might happennow dont distress yourself my dear quoth the deceitful mr jackalspringing to the bank because its not impossible that i may not findthe barber and then you know you may have to wait some time aconsiderable time in fact before i return so dont injure yourhealth for my sake if you please with that he blew her a kiss andtrotted away with his tail upof course he never came back though trusting miss crocodile waitedpatiently for him at last she understood what a gay deceitful fellowhe was and determined to have her revenge on him one way or anotherso she hid herself in the water under the roots of a tree close to aford where the jackal always came to drink by and by sure enoughhe came lilting along in a selfsatisfied way and went right into thewater for a good long draft whereupon miss crocodile seized him bythe right legs and held on he guessed at once what had happened andcalled out oh my hearts adored im drowning im drowning ifyou love me leave hold of that old root and get a good grip of my legit is just next doorhearing this miss crocodile thought she must have made a mistake andletting go the jackals leg in a hurry seized an old root close byand held on whereupon mr jackal jumped nimbly to shore and ran offwith his tail up calling out have a little patience my beauty thebarber will come some daybut this time miss crocodile knew better than to wait and being nowdreadfully angry she crawled away to the jackals hole and slippinginside lay quietby and by mr jackal came lilting along with his tail up ho hothat is your game is it said he to himself when he saw the trail ofthe crocodile in the sandy soil so he stood outside and said aloudbless my stars what has happened i dont half like to go in forwhenever i come home my wife always calls outoh dearest

jackal and the iguanaby flora annie steelone moonlight night a miserable halfstarved jackal skulking throughthe village found a wornout pair of shoes in the gutter they weretoo tough for him to eat so determined to make some use of them hestrung them to his ears like earrings and going down to the edge ofthe pond gathered all the old bones he could find together and built aplatform of them plastering it over with mudon this he sat in a dignified attitude and when any animal came to thepond to drink he cried out in a loud voice hi stop you must nottaste a drop till you have done homage to me so repeat these verseswhich i have composed in honor of the occasionsilver is his dais plastered oer with goldin his ears are jewelssome prince i must beholdnow as most of the animals were very thirsty and in a great hurry todrink they did not care to dispute the matter but gabbled off thewords without a second thought even the royal tiger treating it as ajest repeated the jackals rime in consequence of which the latterbecame quite a cockahoop and really began to believe he was apersonage of great importanceby and by an iguana or big lizard came waddling down to the waterlooking for all the world like a baby alligatorhi you there sang out the jackal you mustnt drink until youhave saidsilver is his dais plastered oer with goldin his ears are jewelssome prince i must beholdpouf pouf pouf gasped the iguana mercy on us how dry mythroat is mightnt i have just a wee sip of water first and then icould do justice to your admirable lines at present i am as hoarse asa crowby all means replied the jackal with a gratified smirk i flattermyself the verses are good especially when well recitedso the iguana nose down in the water drank away until the jackalbegan to think he would never leave off and was quite taken aback whenhe finally came to an end of his draft and began to move awayhi hi cried the jackal recovering his presence of mind stop abit and saysilver is his dais plastered oer with goldin his ears are jewelssome prince i must beholddear me replied the iguana politely i was very near forgettinglet me seei must try my voice firstdo re me fa sol la sithatis right now how does it runsilver is his dais plastered oer with goldin his ears are jewelssome prince i must beholdrepeated the jackal not observing that the lizard was carefully edgingfarther and farther awayexactly so returned the iguana i think i could say thatwhereupon he sang out at the top of his voicebones made up his dais with mud its plastered oerold shoes are his eardrops a jackal nothing moreand turning round he bolted for his hole as hard as he couldthe jackal could scarcely believe his ears and sat dumb withastonishment then rage lending him wings he flew after the lizardwho despite his short legs and scanty breath put his best footforemost and scuttled away at a great rateit was a near race however for just as he popped into his hole thejackal caught him by the tail and held on then it was a case ofpull butcher pull baker until the lizard made certain his tailmust come off and he felt as if his front teeth would come out stillnot an inch did either budge one way or the other and there theymight have remained till the present day had not the iguana calledout in his sweetest tones friend i give in just leave hold of mytail will you then i can turn round and come outwhereupon the jackal let go and the tail disappeared up the hole in atwinkling while all the reward the jackal got for digging away untilhis nails were nearly worn out was hearing the iguana sing softlybones made up his dais with mud its plastered oerold shoes are his eardrops a jackal nothing morethe bears bad bargainby flora annie steelonce upon a time a very old woodman lived with his very old wife in atiny hut close to the orchard of a very rich man so close that theboughs of a pear tree hung right over the cottage yard now it wasagreed between the rich man and the woodman that if any of the fruitfell into the yard the old couple were to be allowed to eat it so youmay imagine with what hungry eyes they watched the pears ripening andprayed for a storm of wind or a flock of flying foxes or anythingwhich would cause the fruit to fall but nothing came and the oldwife who was a grumbling scolding old thing declared they wouldinfallibly become beggars so she took to giving her husband nothingbut dry bread to eat and insisted on his working harder than evertill the poor soul got quite thin and all because the pears would notfall downat last the woodman turned round and declared he would not work moreunless his wife gave him khichri for his dinner so with a very badgrace the old woman took some rice and pulse some butter and spicesand began to cook a savory khichri what an appetizing smell it hadto be sure the woodman was for gobbling it up as soon as ever it wasready no no cried the greedy old wife not till you have broughtme in another load of wood and mind it is a good one you must workfor your dinnerso the old man set off to the forest and began to hack and to hew withsuch a will that he soon had quite a large bundle and with everyfaggot he cut he seemed to smell the savory khichri and think of thefeast that was comingjust then a bear came swinging by with its great black nose tilted inthe air and its little keen eyes peering about for bears though goodenough fellows on the whole are just dreadfully inquisitivepeace be with you friend said the bear and what may you be goingto do with that remarkably large bundle of woodit is for my wife returned the woodman the fact is he addedconfidentially smacking his lips she has made such a khichri fordinner and if i bring in a good bundle of wood she is pretty sure togive me a plentiful portion oh my dear fellow you should just smellthat khichriat this the bears mouth began to water for like all bears he was adreadful gluttondo you think your wife would give mite some too if i brought her abundle of wood he asked anxiouslyperhaps if it is a very big load answered the woodman craftilywouldwould four hundredweight be enough asked the bearim afraid not returned the woodman shaking his head you seekhichri is an expensive dish to makethere is rice in it and plenty ofbutter and pulse andwouldwould eight hundredweight dosay half a ton and its a bargain quoth the woodmanhalf a ton is a large quantity sighed the bearthere is saffron in the khichri remarked the woodman casuallythe bear licked his lips and his little eyes twinkled with greed anddelightwell its a bargain go home sharp and tell your wife to keep thekhichri hot ill be with you in a triceaway went the woodman in great glee to tell his wife how the bear hadagreed to bring half a ton of wood in return for a share of thekhichrinow the wife could not help allowing that her husband had made a goodbargain but being by nature a grumbler she was determined not to bepleased so she began to scold the old man for not having settledexactly the share the bear was to have for said she he willgobble up the potful before we have finished our first helpingon this the woodman became quite pale in that case he said wehad better begin now and have a fair start so without more ado theysquatted down on the floor with the brass pot full of khichri betweenthem and began to eat as fast as they couldremember to leave some for the bear wife said the woodman speakingwith his mouth crammed fullcertainly certainly she replied helping herself to anotherhandfulmy dear cried the old woman in her turn with her mouth so full shecould hardly speak remember the poor bearcertainly certainly my love returned the old man taking anothermouthfulso it went on till there was not a single grain left in the potwhats to be done now said the woodman it is all your fault wifefor eating so muchmy fault retorted his wife scornfully why you ate twice as muchas i didno i didntyes you did men always eat more than womenno they dontyes they dowell its no use quarreling about it now said the woodman thekhichris gone and the bear will be furiousthat wouldnt matter much if we could get the wood said the greedyold woman ill tell you what we must dowe must lock up everythingthere is to eat in the house leave the khichri pot by the fire andhide in the garret when the bear comes he will think we have gone outand left his dinner for him then he will throw down his bundle andcome in of course he will rampage a little when he finds the pot isempty but he cant do much mischief and i dont think he will takethe trouble of carrying the wood awayso they made haste to lock up all the food and hide themselves in thegarretmeanwhile the bear had been toiling and moiling away at his bundle ofwood which took him much longer to collect than he expected howeverat last he arrived quite exhausted at the woodcutters cottage seeingthe brass khichri pot by the fire he threw down his load and went inand thenmercy wasnt he angry when he found nothing in itnot even agrain of rice nor a tiny wee bit of pulse but only a smell that wasso uncommonly nice that he actually cried with rage and disappointmenthe flew into the most dreadful temper but though he turned the housetopsyturvy he could not find a morsel of food finally he declaredhe would take the wood away again but as the crafty old woman hadimagined when he came to the task he did not care even for the sakeof revenge to carry so heavy a burdeni wont go away emptyhanded said he to himself seizing the khichripot if i cant get the taste ill have the smellnow as he left the cottage he caught sight of the beautiful goldenpears hanging over into the yard his mouth began to water at oncefor he was desperately hungry and the pears were the best of theseason in a trice he was on the wall up the tree and gathering thebiggest and ripest one he could find was just putting it into hismouth when a thought struck himif i take these pears home i shall be able to sell them for ever somuch to the other bears and then with the money i shall be able to buysome khichri ha ha i shall have the best of the bargain afterallso saying he began to gather the ripe pears as fast as he could andput them in the khichri pot but whenever he came to an unripe one hewould shake his head and say no one would buy that yet it is a pityto waste it so he would pop it into his mouth and eat it making wryfaces if it was very sournow all this time the woodmans wife had been watching the bear througha crevice and holding her breath for fear of discovery but at lastwhat with being asthmatic and having a cold in her head she couldhold it no longer and just as the khichri pot was quite full of goldenripe pears out she came with the most tremendous sneeze you everheardahcheu the bear thinking some one had fired a gun at him dropped the khichripot into the cottage yard and fled into the forest as fast as his legswould carry himso the woodrnan and his wife got the khichri the wood and the covetedpears but the poor bear got nothing but a very bad stomachache fromeating unripe fruitthe thief and the foxby ramaswarni rajua man tied his horse to a tree and went into an inn a thief hid

you must take withyou said the man espen ashiepattle thanked him for the ship saidhe would do so and then sailed awaywhen he had sailed some distance he came to a long thin tramp who waslying near some rocks eating stoneswhat sort of a fellow are you that you lie there eating stonesasked ashiepattle the tramp said he was so fond of meat he couldnever get enough therefore he was obliged to eat stones and then heasked if he might go with him in the shipif you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board saidashiepattleyes that he would but he must take with him some large stones forfoodwhen they had sailed some distance they met one who was lying on theside of a sunny hill sucking at a bungwho are you said ashiepattle and what is the good of lying theresucking that bungoh when one hasnt got the barrel one must be satisfied with thebung said the man im always so thirsty i can never get enoughbeer and wine and then he asked for leave to go with him in theshipif you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board saidashiepattleyes that he would and so he went on board and took the bung with himto allay his thirstwhen they had sailed a while again they met one who was lying with hisear to the ground listeningwho are you and what is the good of lying there on the groundlistening said ashiepattleim listening to the grass for i have such good ears that i can hearthe grass growing said the man and then he asked leave to go withhim in the ship ashiepattle could not say nay to that so he saidif you want to go with me you must make haste and get on boardyes the man would and he also went on boardwhen they had sailed some distance they came to one who was standingtaking aim with a gunwho are you and what is the good of standing there aiming like thatasked ashiepattleso the man said i have such good eyes that i can hit anything rightto the end of the world and then he asked for leave to go with him inthe shipif you want to go with me you must make haste and get on board saidashiepattleyes that he would and he went on boardwhen they had sailed some distance again they came to one who washopping and limping about on one leg and on the other he had seven tonweightswho are you said ashiepattle and what is the good of hopping andlimping about on one leg with seven ton weights on the otheri am so light said the man that if i walked on both my legs ishould get to the end of the world in less than five minutes and thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the shipif you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board saidashiepattleyes that he would and so he joined ashiepattle and his crew on theshipwhen they had sailed on some distance they met one who was standingholding his hand to his mouthwho are you said ashiepattle and what is the good of standingthere holding your mouth like thatoh i have seven summers and fifteen winters in my body said theman so i think i ought to keep my mouth shut for if they get out allat the same time they would finish off the world altogether and thenhe asked for leave to go with him in the shipif you want to go with us you must make haste and get on board saidashiepattleyes that he would and then he joined the others on the shipwhen they had sailed a long time they came to the kings palaceashiepattle went straight in to the king and said the ship stood readyin the courtyard outside and now he wanted the princess as the kinghad promisedthe king did not like this very much for ashiepattle did not cut avery fine figure he was black and sooty and the king did not care togive his daughter to such a tramp so he told ashiepattle that he wouldhave to wait a littlebut you can have her all the same if by this time tomorrow you canempty my storehouse of three hundred barrels of meat said the kingi suppose i must try said ashiepattle but perhaps you dont mindmy taking one of my crew with meyes you can do that and take all six if you like said the kingfor he was quite sure that even if ashiepattle took six hundred withhim it would be impossible so ashiepattle took with him the one whoate stones and always hungered after meatwhen they came next morning and opened the storehouse they found he hadeaten all the meat except six small legs of mutton one for each ofhis companions ashiepattle then went to the king and said thestorehouse was empty and he supposed he could now have the princessthe king went into the storehouse and sure enough it was quite emptybut ashiepattle was still black and sooty and the king thought it wasreally too bad that such a tramp should have his daughter so he saidhe had a cellar full of beer and old wine three hundred barrels ofeach kind which he would have him drink firsti dont mind your having my daughter if you can drink them up by thistime tomorrow said the kingi suppose i must try said ashiepattle but perhaps you dont mindmy taking one of my crew with meyes you may do that said the king for he was quite sure there wastoo much beer and wine even for all seven of them ashiepattle tookwith him the one who was always sucking the bung and was alwaysthirsty and the king then shut them down in the cellarthere the thirsty one drank barrel after barrel as long as there wasany left but in the last barrel he left a couple of pints to each ofhis companionsin the morning the cellar was opened and ashiepattle went at once tothe king and said he had finished the beer and wine and now hesupposed he could have the princess as the king had promisedwell i must first go down to the cellar and see said the king forhe could not believe it but when he got there he found nothing butempty barrelsbut ashiepattle was both black and sooty and the king thought itwouldnt do for him to have such a son in law so he said that ifashiepattle could get water from the end of the world in ten minutesfor the princesss tea he could have both her and half the kingdomfor he thought that task would be quite impossiblei suppose i must try said ashiepattle and sent for the one of hiscrew who jumped about on one leg and had seven ton weights on theother and told him he must take off the weights and use his legs asquickly as he could for he must have water from the end of the worldfor the princesss tea in ten minutesso he took off the weights got a bucket and set off and the nextmoment he was out of sight but they waited and waited and still hedid not return at last it wanted but three minutes to the time andthe king became as pleased as if he had won a big wagerthen ashiepattle called the one who could hear the grass grow and toldhim to listen and find out what had become of their companionhe has fallen asleep at the well said he who could hear the grassgrow i can hear him snoring and a troll is scratching his headashiepattle then called the one who could shoot to the end of the worldand told him to send a bullet into the troll he did so and hit thetroll right in the eye the troll gave such a yell that he woke theman who had come to fetch the water for the tea and when he returnedto the palace there was still one minute left out of the tenashiepattle went straight to the king and said here is the waterand now he supposed he could have the princess for surely the kingwould not make any more fuss about it now but the king thought thatashiepattle was just as black and sooty as ever and did not like tohave him for a soninlaw so he said he had three hundred fathoms ofwood with which he was going to dry corn in the bakehouse and hewouldnt mind ashiepattle having his daughter if he would first sit inthe bakehouse and burn all the wood he should then have the princessand that without faili suppose i must try said ashiepattle but perhaps you dont mindmy taking one of my crew with meoh no you can take all six said the king for he thought it wouldbe warm enough for all of themashiepattle took with him the one who had fifteen winters and sevensummers in his body and in the evening he went across to thebakehouse but the king had piled up so much wood on the fire that youmight almost have melted iron in the room they could not get out ofit for no sooner were they inside than the king fastened the bolt andput a couple of padlocks on the door besides ashiepattle then said tohis companionyou had better let out six or seven winters so that we may getsomething like summer weather herethey were then just able to exist but during the night it got coldagain and ashiepattle then told the man to let out a couple of summersand so they slept far into the next day but when they heard the kingoutside ashiepattle saidyou must let out a couple more winters but you must manage it so thatthe last winter you let out strikes the king right in the facehe did so and when the king opened the door expecting to findashiepattle and his companion burned to cinders he saw them huddlingtogether and shivering with cold till their teeth chattered the sameinstant ashiepattles companion with the fifteen winters in his bodylet loose the last one right in the kings face which swelled up intoa big chilblaincan i have the princess now asked ashiepattleyes take her and keep her and the kingdom into the bargain said theking who dared not refuse any longer and so the wedding took placeand they feasted and made merry and fired off guns and powderwhile the people were running about searching for wadding for theirguns they took me instead gave me some porridge in a bottle and somemilk in a basket and fired me right across here so that i could tellyou how it all happenedthe squires brideby p c asbjrnsenonce upon a time there was a rich squire who owned a large farm andhad plenty of silver at the bottom of his chest and money in the bankbesides but he felt there was something wanting for he was a widowerone day the daughter of a neighboring farmer was working for him in thehayfield the squire saw her and liked her very much and as she wasthe child of poor parents he thought if he only hinted that he wantedher she would be ready to marry him at onceso he told her he had been thinking of getting married againaye one may think of many things said the girl laughing slylyin her opinion the old fellow ought to be thinking of something thatbehooved him better than getting marriedwell you see i thought that you should be my wifeno thank you all the same said she thats not at all likelythe squire was not accustomed to be gainsaid and the more she refusedhim the more determined he was to get herbut as he made no progress in her favor he sent for her father and toldhim that if he could arrange the matter with his daughter he wouldforgive him the money he had lent him and he would also give him thepiece of land which lay close to his meadow into the bargainyes you may be sure ill bring my daughter to her senses said thefather she is only a child and she doesnt know whats best forher but all his coaxing and talking did not help matters she wouldnot have the squire she said if he sat buried in gold up to his earsthe squire waited day after day but at last he became so angry andimpatient that he told the father if he expected him to stand by hispromise he would have to put his foot down and settle the matter nowfor he would not wait any longerthe man knew no other way out of it but to let the squire geteverything ready for the wedding and when the parson and the weddingguests had arrived the squire should send for the girl as if she werewanted for some work on the farm when she arrived she would have tobe married right away so that she would have no time to think it overthe squire thought this was well and good and so he began brewing andbaking and getting ready for the wedding in grand style when theguests had arrived the squire called one of his farm lads and told himto run down to his neighbor and ask him to send him what he hadpromisedbut if you are not back in a twinkling he said shaking his fist athim illhe did not say more for the lad ran off as if he had been shot atmy master has sent me to ask for that you promised him said the ladwhen he got to the neighbor but there is no time to be lost for heis terribly busy todayyes yes run down into the meadow and take her with you there shegoes answered the neighborthe lad ran off and when he came to the meadow he found the daughterthere raking the hayi am to fetch what your father has promised my master said the ladah ha thought she is that what they are up toah indeed she said i suppose its that little bay mare of oursyou had better go and take her she stands there tethered on the otherside of the pea field said the girlthe boy jumped on the back of the bay mare and rode home at fullgallophave you got her with you asked the squireshe is down at the door said the ladtake her up to the room my mother had said the squirebut master how can that be managed said the ladyou must just do as i tell you said the squire if you cannotmanage her alone you must get the men to help you for he thought thegirl might turn obstreperouswhen the lad saw his masters face he knew it would be no use togainsay him so he went and got all the farm tenants who were there tohelp him some pulled at the head and the forelegs of the mare andothers pushed from behind and at last they got her up the stairs andinto the room there lay all the wedding finery readynow thats done master said the lad but it was a terrible jobit was the worst i have ever had here on the farmnever mind you shall not have done it for nothing said his masternow send the women up to dress herbut i say master said the ladnone of your talk said the squire tell them they must dress herand mind and not forget either wreath or crownthe lad ran into the kitchenlook here lasses he said you must go upstairs and dress up thebay mare as bride i expect the master wants to give the guests alaughthe women dressed the bay mare in everything that was there and thenthe lad went and told his master that now she was ready dressed withwreath and crown and allvery well bring her down said the squire i will receive hermyself at the door said hethere was a terrible clatter on the stairs for that bride you knowhad no silken shoes onwhen the door was opened and the squires bride entered the parlor youcan imagine there was a good deal of tittering and grinningand as for the squire you may he sure line had had enough of thatbride and they say he never went courting againthe doll in the grassby p c asbjrnsenonce upon a time there was a king who had twelve sons when they weregrown up he told them they must go out into the world and findthemselves wives who must all be able to spin and weave and make ashirt in one day else he would not have them for daughtersinlaw hegave each of his sons a horse and a new suit of armor and so they setout in the world to look for wiveswhen they had traveled a bit on the way they said they would not takeashiepattle with them for he was good for nothing ashiepattle muststop behind there was no help for it he did not know what he shoulddo or which way he should turn he became so sad that he got off thehorse and sat down on the grass and began to crywhen he had sat a while one of the tussocks among the grass began tomove and out of it came a small white figure as it came nearerashiepattle saw that it was a beautiful little girl but she was sotiny so very very tinyshe went up to him and asked him if he would come below and pay a visitto the doll in the grassyes that he would and so he did when he came down below the dollin the grass was sitting in a chair dressed very finely and lookingstill more beautiful she asked ashiepattle where he was going andwhat was his errandhe told her they were twelve brothers and that the king had given themeach a horse and a suit of armor and told them to go out in the worldand find themselves wives but they must all be able to spin and weaveand make a shirt in a dayif you can do that and will become my wife i will not travel anyfarther said ashiepattle to the doll in the grassyes that she would and she set to work at once to get the shirt spunwoven and made but it was so tiny so very very tiny no biggerthansoashiepattle then returned home taking the shirt with him but when hebrought it out he felt very shy because it was so small but the kingsaid he could have her for all that and you can imagine how happy andjoyful ashiepattle becamethe road did not seem long to him as he set out to fetch his littlesweetheart when he came to the doll in the grass he wanted her to sitwith him on his horse but no that she wouldnt she said she wouldsit and drive in a silver spoon and she had two small while horseswhich would draw her so they set out he on his horse and she in thesilver spoon and the horses which drew her were two small white miceashiepattle always kept to one side of the road for he was so afraidhe should ride over her she was so very very tinywhen they had traveled a bit on the way they came to a large lakethere ashiepattles horse took fright and shied over to the other sideof the road and upset the spoon so that the doll in the grass fellinto the water ashiepattle became very sad for he did not know howhe should get her out again but after a while a merman brought her upbut now she had become just as big as any other grownup being and wasmuch more beautiful than she was before so he placed her in front ofhim on the horse and rode homewhen ashiepattle got there all his brothers had also returned eachwith a sweetheart but they were so ugly and illfavored and badtempered that they had come to blows with their sweethearts on theirway home on their heads they had hats which were painted with tar andsoot and this had run from their hats down their faces so that theywere still uglier and more illfavored to beholdwhen the brothers saw ashiepattles sweetheart they all became enviousof him but the king was so pleased with ashiepattle and his sweetheartthat he drove all the others away and so ashiepattle was married tothe doll in the grass and afterward they lived happy and comfortablefor a long long while and if they are not dead they must be stillalivethe bear and the foxby p c asbjrnsenonce upon a time there was a bear who sat on a sunny hillside taking anap just then a fox came slinking by and saw himaha have i caught you napping grandfather see if i dont play youa trick this time said reynard to himselfhe then found three wood mice and laid them on a stump of a tree justunder the bears noseboo bruin peter the hunter is just behind that stump shouted thefox right into the bears ear and then took to his heels and made offinto the woodthe bear woke at once and when he saw the three mice he became soangry that he lifted his paw and was just going to strike them for hethought it was they who had shouted in his earbut just then he saw reynards tail between the bushes and he set offat such a speed that the branches crackled under him and bruin wassoon so close upon reynard that he caught him by the right hind legjust as be was running into a hole under a pine treereynard was now in a fix but he was not to be outwitted and he criedslip pine root grip fox foot and so the bear let go his hold butthe fox laughed far down in the hole and saidi sold you that time also grandfatherout of sight is not out of mind said the bear who was in a finefurythe other morning when bruin came trudging across the moor with a fatpig master reynard was lying on a stone by the moorsidegoodday grandfather said the fox what nice thing have you gottherepork said the beari have got something tasty as well said the foxwhats that said the bearits the biggest bees nest i ever found said reynardah indeed said the bear grinning and his mouth began to water hethought a little honey would be so nice shall we change victualshe saidno i wont do that said reynard but they made a wager aboutnaming three kinds of trees if the fox could say them quicker thanthe bear he was to have one bite at the pig but if the bear could saythem quicker he was to have one suck at the bees nest the bearthought he would be able to suck all the honey up at one gulpwell said the fox thats all well and good but if i win you mustpromise to tear off the bristles where i want to have a bite he saidwell i suppose i must since you are too lazy yourself said thebearthen they began to name the treesspruce fir pine growled the bear his voice was very gruff butall these were only different names of one kind of treeash aspen oak screeched the fox so that the forest resounded hehad thus won the bet and so he jumped down took the heart out of thepig at one bite and tried to run off but the bear was angry becausehe had taken the best bit of the whole pig and seized hold of him byhis tail and held him fastjust wait a bit said the bear who was furiousnever mind grandfather if youll let me go you shall have a taste ofmy honey said the foxwhen the bear heard this he let go his hold and the fox jumped up onthe stone after the honeyover this nest said reynard ill put a leaf and in the leaf thereis a hole through which you can suck the honey he then put the nestright up under the bears nose pulled away the leaf jumped on to thestone and began grinning and laughing for there was neither honey norhoneycomb in the nest it was a wasps nest as big as a mans headfull of wasps and out they swarmed and stung the bear in his eyes andears and on his mouth and snout he had so much to do with scratchingthem off him that he had no the to think of reynardever since the bear has been afraid of waspsonce the fox and the bear made up their minds to have a field incommon they found a small clearing far away in the forest where theysowed rye the first yearnow we must share and share alike said reynard if you will havethe roots i will have the tops he saidyes bruin was quite willing but when they had thrashed the crop thefox got all the corn while the bear got nothing but the roots andtaresbruin didnt like this but the fox said it was only as they hadagreedthis year i am the gainer said the fox another year it will beyour turn you can then have the tops and i will be satisfied with therootsnext spring the fox asked the bear if he didnt think turnips would bethe right thing for that yearyes thats better food than corn said the bear and the fox thoughtthe samewhen the autumn came the fox took the turnips but the bear only gotthe topsthe bear then became so angry that he parted company then and therewith reynardone day the bear was lying eating a horse which he had killed reynardwas about again and came slinking along his mouth watering for a tastybit of the horsefleshhe sneaked in and out and round about till he came up behind the bearwhen he made a spring to the other side of the carcass snatching apiece as he jumped acrossthe bear was not slow either he made a dash after reynard and caughtthe tip of his red tail in his paw since that time the fox has alwayshad a white tip to his tailwait a bit reynard and come here said the bear and ill teach youhow to catch horsesyes reynard was quite willing to learn that but he didnt trusthimself too near the bearwhen you see a horse lying asleep in a sunny place said the bearyou must tie yourself fast with the hair of his tail to your brushand then fasten your teeth in his thigh he saidbefore long the fox found a horse lying asleep on a sunny hillside andso he did as the bear had told him he knotted and tied himself well tothe horse with the hair of the tail and then fastened his teeth intohis thighup jumped the horse and began to kick and gallop so that reynard wasdashed against stock and stone and was so bruised and battered that henearly lost his sensesall at once a hare rushed by where are you off to in such a hurryreynard said the hareim having a ride bunny said the foxthe hare sat up on his hind legs and laughed till the sides of hismouth split right up to his ears at the thought of reynard having sucha grand ride but since then the fox has never thought of catchinghorses againthat time it was bruin who for once had the better of reynardotherwise they say the bear is as simpleminded as the trollsthe lad who went to the north windby sir george webbe dasentonce upon a time there was an old widow who had one son and she waspoorly and weak her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal forcooking but when he got outside the safe and was just going down thesteps there came the north wind puffing and blowing caught up themeal and so away with it through the air then the lad went back intothe safe for more but when he came out again on the steps if thenorth wind didnt come again and carry off the meal with a puff andmore than that he did so the third time at this the lad got veryangry and as he thought it hard that the north wind should behave sohe thought hed just look him up and ask him to give up his mealso off he went but the way was long and he walked and walked but atlast he came to the north winds housegood day said the lad and thank you for coming to see usyesterdaygood day answered the north wind for his voice was loud and gruffand thanks for coming to see me what do you wantoh answered the lad i only wished to ask you to be so good as tolet me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps for wehavent much to live on and if youre to go on snapping up the morselwe have therell be nothing for it but to starvei havent got your meal said the north wind but if you are in suchneed ill give you a cloth which will get you everything you want ifyou only say cloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of gooddisheswith this the lad was well content but as the way was so long hecouldnt get home in one day he stopped at an inn on the way and whenthey were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a tablewhich stood in the corner and saidcloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good disheshe had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid and all whostood by thought it a fine thing but most of all the landlady sowhen all were fast asleep at dead of night she took the lads clothand put another in its stead just like the one he had got from thenorth wind but which couldnt so much as serve up a bit of dry breadso when the lad awoke he took his cloth and went off with it and thatday he got home to his mothernow said he ive been to the north winds house and a good fellowhe is for he gave me this cloth and when i only say to it clothspread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishes i get any sortof food i pleaseall very true i dare say said his mother but seeing is believingand i shant believe it till i see itso the lad made haste drew out a table laid the cloth on it andsaid cloth spread yourself and serve up all kinds of good dishesbut never a bit of dry bread did the cloth servewell said the lad theres no help for it but to go to the northwind again and away he wentso late in the afternoon he came to where the north wind livedgood evening said the ladgood evening said the north wind i want my rights for that mealof ours which you took said the lad for as for that cloth i gotit isnt worth a pennyive got no meal said the north wind but yonder you have a ramwhich coins nothing but golden ducats as soon as you say to itram ram make moneyso the lad thought this a fine thing but as it was too far to get homethat day he stopped for the night at the same inn where he had sleptbeforebefore he called for anything he tried the truth of what the northwind had said of the ram and found it all right but when the landlordsaw that he thought it was a famous ram and when the lad had fallenasleep he took another which couldnt coin gold ducats and changedthe twonext morning off went the lad and when he got home to his mother hesaidafter all the north wind is a jolly fellow for now he has givenme a ram which can coin golden ducats if i only say ram ram makemoneyall very true i dare say said his mother but i shant believe anysuch stuff until i see the ducats maderam ram make money said the lad but the ram made no moneyso the lad went back again to the north wind and blew him up and saidthe ram was worth nothing and he must have his rights for the mealwell said the north wind ive nothing else to give you but thatold stick in the corner yonder but its a stick of that kind that ifyou say stick stick lay on it lays on till you say stickstick now stopso as the way was long the lad turned in this night too to thelandlord but as he could pretty well guess how things stood as to thecloth and the ram he lay down at once on the bench and began to snoreas if he were asleepnow the landlord who easily saw that the stick must be worthsomething hunted up one which was like it and when he heard the ladsnore was going to change the two but just as the landlord was aboutto take it the lad bawled out stick stick lay onso the stick began to beat the landlord till he jumped over chairs andtables and benches and yelled and roared oh my oh my bid thestick be still else it will beat me to death and you shall have backyour cloth and your ramwhen the lad thought the landlord had got enough he said stickstick now stopthen he took the cloth and put it into his pocket and went home withhis stick in his hand leading the ram by a cord round its horns andso he got his rights for the meal he had lostthe husband who was to mind the houseby sir george webbe dasentonce upon a time there was a man so surly and cross he never thoughthis wife did anything right in the house so one evening in haymakingtime he came home scolding and swearing and showing his teeth andmaking a dustdear love dont be so angry theres a good man said his goodytomorrow lets change our work ill go out with the mowers and mowand you shall mind the house at homeyes the husband thought that would do very well he was quitewilling he saidso early next morning his goody took a scythe over her neck and wentout into the hayfield with the mowers and began to mow but the man wasto mind the house and do the work at homefirst of all he wanted to churn the butter but when he had churned awhile he got thirsty and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel ofale so just when he had knocked in the bung and was putting the tapinto the cask he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen thenoff he ran up the cellar steps with the tap in his hand as fast as hecould to look after the pig lest it should upset the churn but whenhe got up and saw that the pig had already knocked the churn over andstood there routing and grunting amid the cream which was running allover the floor he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot his alebarrel and ran at the pig as hard as he could he caught it too justas it ran out of doors and gave it such a kick that piggy lay for deadon the spot then all at once he remembered he had the tap in hishand but when he got down to the cellar every drop of ale had run outof the caskthen he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill thechurn again and so he began to churn for butter they must have fordinner when he had churned a bit he remembered that their milkingcow was still shut up in the brye and hadnt had a bit to eat or adrop to drink all the morning though the sun was high then all atonce he thought twas too far to take her down to the meadow so hedjust get her up on the housetopfor the house you must know wasthatched with sods and a fine crop of grass was growing therenow their house lay close up against a steep down and he thought if helaid a plank across to the thatch at the back hed easily get the cowupbut still he couldnt leave the churn for there was his little babecrawling about the floor and if i leave it he thought the childis sure to upset it so he took the churn on his back and went outwith it but then he thought hed better first water the cow before heturned her out on the thatch so he took up a bucket to draw water outof the well but as he stooped down at the wells brink all the creamran out of the churn over his shoulders and so down into the wellnow it was near dinner time and he hadnt even got the butter yet sohe thought hed best boil the porridge and filled the pot with waterand hung it over the fire when he had done that he thought the cowmight perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck sohe got up on the house to tie her up one end of the rope he made fastto the cows neck and the other he slipped down the chimney and tiedround his own thigh and he had to make haste for the water now beganto boil in the pot and he had still to grind the oatmealso he began to grind away but while he was hard at it down fell thecow off the housetop after all and as she fell she dragged the man upthe chimney by the rope there he stuck fast and as for the cow shehung halfway down the wall swinging between heaven and earth for shecould neither get down nor upand now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for herhusband to come and call them home to dinner but never a call theyhad at last she thought shed waited long enough and went home butwhen she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place sheran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe but as she did thisdown came her husband out of the chimney and so when his old dame cameinside the kitchen there she found him standing on his head in theporridge pothow one went out to wooby sir george webbe dasento nce upon a time there was a lad who went out to woo him a wifeamong other places he came to a farmhouse where the household werelittle better than beggars but when the wooer came in they wanted tomake out that they were well to do as you may guess now the husbandhad got a new arm to his

the mill and her backbone snapped intwo but i wasnt put out not i for i took a spruce sapling and putit into her for a backbone and she had no other backbone all the whilewe had her but the sapling grew up into such a tall tree that iclimbed right up to the sky by it and when i got there i saw a ladysitting and spinning the foam of the sea into pigsbristle ropes butjust then the sprucefir broke short off and i couldnt get downagain so the lady let me down by one of the ropes and down i slippedstraight into a foxs hole and who should sit there but my mother andyour father cobbling shoes and just as i stepped in my mother gaveyour father such a box on the ear that it made his whiskers curlthats a story said the princess my father never did any suchthing in all his born daysso boots got the princess to wife and half the kingdom besidesthe witch in the stone boatretold by andrew langthere was once a king and queen and they had a son called sigurd whowas very strong and active and goodlooking when the king came to bebowed down with the weight of years he spoke to his son and said thatnow it was time for him to look out for a fitting match for himselffor he did not know how long he might last now and he would like tosee him married before he diedsigurd was not averse to this and asked his father where he thought itbest to look for a wife the king answered that in a certain countrythere was a king who had a beautiful daughter and he thought it wouldbe most desirable if sigurd could get her so the two parted andsigurd prepared for the journey and went to where his father haddirected himhe came to the king and asked his daughters hand which was readilygranted him but only on the condition that he should remain there aslong as he could for the king himself was not strong and not very ableto govern his kingdom sigurd accepted this condition but added thathe would have to get leave to go home again to his own country when heheard news of his fathers death after that sigurd married theprincess and helped his fatherinlaw to govern the kingdom he andthe princess loved each other dearly and after a year a son came tothem who was two years old when word came to sigurd that his fatherwas dead sigurd now prepared to return home with his wife and childand went on board ship to go by seathey had sailed for several days when the breeze suddenly fell andthere came a dead calm at a time when they needed only one days voyageto reach home sigurd and his queen were one day on deck when most ofthe others on the ship had fallen asleep there they sat and talkedfor a while and had their little son along with them after a timesigurd became so heavy with sleep that he could no longer keep awakeso he went below and lay down leaving the queen alone on the deckplaying with her sona good while after sigurd had gone below the queen saw something blackon the sea which seemed to be coming nearer as it approached shecould make out that it was a boat and could see the figure of some onesitting in it and rowing it at last the boat came alongside the shipand now the queen saw that it was a stone boat out of which there cameon board the ship a fearfully ugly witch the queen was morefrightened than words can describe and could neither speak a word normove from the place so as to awaken the king or the sailors the witchcame right up to the queen took the child from her and laid it on thedeck then she took the queen and stripped her of all her fine clotheswhich she proceeded to put on herself and looked then like a humanbeing last of all she took the queen put her into the boat and saidthis spell i lay upon you that you slacken not your course until youcome to my brother in the under worldthe queen sat stunned and motionless but the boat at once shot awayfrom the ship with her and before long she was out of sightwhen the boat could no longer be seen the child began to cry andthough the witch tried to quiet it she could not manage it so withthe child on her arm she went below to where the king was sleepingand awakened him scolding him for leaving them alone on deck while heand all the crew were asleep it was great carelessness of him shesaid to leave no one to watch the ship with hersigurd was greatly surprised to hear his queen scold him so much forshe had never said an angry word to him before but he thought it wasquite excusable in this case and tried to quiet the child along withher but it was no use then he went and wakened the sailors and badethem hoist the sails for a breeze had sprung up and was blowingstraight toward the harborthey soon reached the land which sigurd was to rule over and found allthe people sorrowful for the old kings death but they became gladwhen they got sigurd back to the court and made him king over themthe kings son however hardly ever stopped crying from the time hehad been taken from his mother on the deck of the ship although he hadalways been such a good child before so that at last the king had toget a nurse for himone of the maids of the court as soon as thechild got into her charge he stopped crying and behaved as well asbeforeafter the sea voyage it seemed to the king that the queen had alteredvery much in many ways and not for the better he thought her muchmore haughty and stubborn and difficult to deal with than she used tobe before long others began to notice this as well as the king inthe court there were two young fellows one of eighteen years old theother of nineteen who were very fond of playing chess and often satlong inside playing at it their room was next the queens and oftenduring the day they heard the queen talkingone day they paid more attention than usual when they heard her talkand put their ears close to a crack in the wall between the rooms andheard the queen say quite plainly when i yawn a little then i am anice little maiden when i yawn halfway then i am half a troll andwhen i yawn fully then i am a troll altogetheras she said this she yawned tremendously and in a moment had put onthe appearance of a fearfully ugly troll then there came up throughthe floor of the room a threeheaded giant with a trough full of meatwho saluted her as his sister and set down the trough before her shebegan to eat out of it and never stopped till she had finished it theyoung fellows saw all this going on but did not hear the two of themsay anything to each other they were astonished though at howgreedily the queen devoured the meat and how much she ate of it andwere no longer surprised that she took so little when she sat at tablewith the king as soon as she had finished it the giant disappearedwith the trough by the same way as he had come and the queen returnedto her human shapenow we must go back to the kings son after he had been put in chargeof the nurse one evening after she had lit a candle and was holdingthe child several planks sprang up in the floor of the room and outat the opening came a beautiful woman dressed in white with an ironbelt round her waist to which was fastened an iron chain that wentdown into the ground the woman came up to the nurse took the childfrom her and pressed it to her breast then she gave it back to thenurse and returned by the same way as she had come and the floorclosed over her again although the woman had not spoken a single wordto her the nurse was very much frightened but told no one about itnext evening the same thing happened again just as before but as thewoman was going away she said in a sad tone two are gone and one onlyis left and then disappeared as before the nurse was still morefrightened when she heard the woman say this and thought that perhapssome danger was hanging over the child though she had no ill opinionof the unknown woman who indeed had behaved toward the child as ifit were her own the most mysterious thing was the woman saying andonly one is left but the nurse guessed that this must mean that onlyone day was left since she had come for two days alreadyat last the nurse made up her mind to go to the king she told him thewhole story and asked him to be present in person the next day aboutthe time when the woman usually came the king promised to do so andcame to the nurses room a little before the time and sat down on achair with his drawn sword in his hand soon after the planks in thefloor sprang up as before and the woman came up dressed in whitewith the iron belt and chain the king saw at once that it was his ownqueen and immediately hewed asunder the iron chain that was fastenedto the belt this was followed by such noises and crashings down inthe earth that all the kings palace shook so that no one expectedanything else than to see every bit of it shaken to pieces at lastthe noises and shaking stopped and they began to come to themselvesagainthe king and queen embraced each other and she told him the wholestoryhow the witch came to the ship when they were all asleep and senther off in the boat after she had gone so far that she could not seethe ship she sailed on through darkness until she landed beside athreeheaded giant the giant wished her to marry him but sherefused whereupon he shut her up by herself and told her she wouldnever get free until she consented after a time she began to plan howto get her freedom and at last told him that she would consent if hewould allow her to visit her son on earth three days on end this heagreed to but put on her this iron belt and chain the other end ofwhich he fastened around his own waist and the great noises that wereheard when the king cut the chain must have been caused by the giantsfalling down the underground passage when the chain gave way sosuddenly the giants dwelling indeed was right under the palaceand the terrible shakings must have been caused by him in his deaththroesthe king now understood how the queen he had had for some time past hadbeen so illtempered he at once had a sack drawn over her head andmade her be stoned to death and after that torn in pieces by untamedhorses the two young fellows also told now what they had heard andseen in the queens room for before this they had been afraid to sayanything about it on account of the queens powerthe real queen was now restored to all her dignity and was beloved byall the nurse was married to a nobleman and the king and queen gaveher splendid presentsthe snuffiboxby paul sbillotas often happens in this world there was once a young man who spentall his time in traveling one day as he was walking along he pickedup a snuffbox he opened it and the snuffbox said to him in thespanish language what do you want he was very much frightenedbut luckily instead of throwing the box away he only shut it tightand put it in his pocket then he went on away away away and as hewent he said to himself if it says to me again what do you want ishall know better what to say this time so he took out the snuffboxand opened it and again it asked what do you want my hat full ofgold answered the youth and immediately it was fullour young man was enchanted henceforth he should never be in need ofanything so on he traveled away away away through thick foreststill at last he came to a beautiful castle in the castle there liveda king the young man walked round and round the castle not caringwho saw him till the king noticed him and asked what he was doingthere i was just looking at your castle you would like to haveone like it wouldnt you the young man did not reply but when itgrew dark he took out his snuffbox and opened the lid what do youwant build me a castle with laths of gold and tiles of diamond andthe furniture all of silver and gold he had scarcely finishedspeaking when there stood in front of him exactly opposite the kingspalace a castle built precisely as he had ordered when the kingawoke he was struck dumb at the sight of the magnificent house shiningin the rays of the sun the servants could not do their work forstopping to stare at it then the king dressed himself and went to seethe young man and he told him plainly that he was a very powerfulprince and that he hoped that they might all live together in onehouse or the other and that the king would give him his daughter towife so it all turned out just as the king wished the young manmarried the princess and they lived happily in the palace of goldbut the kings wife was jealous both of the young man and of her owndaughter the princess had told her mother about the snuffbox whichgave them everything they wanted and the queen bribed a servant tosteal the snuffbox they noticed carefully where it was put away everynight and one evening when the whole world was asleep the womanstole it and brought it to her old mistress oh how happy the queenwas she opened the lid and the snuffbox said to her what do youwant and she answered at once i want you to take me and my husbandand my servants and this beautiful house and set us down on the otherside of the red sea but my daughter and her husband are to staybehindwhen the young couple woke up they found themselves back in the oldcastle without their snuffbox they hunted for it high and low butquite vainly the young man felt that no time was to be lost and hemounted his horse and filled his pockets with as much gold as he couldcarry on he went away away away but he sought the snuffbox invain all up and down the neighboring countries and very soon he cameto the end of all his money but still he went on as fast as thestrength of his horse would let him begging his waysome one told him that he ought to consult the moon for the moontraveled far and might be able to tell him something so he went awayaway away and ended somehow or other by reaching the land of themoon there he found a little old woman who said to him what are youdoing here my son eats all living things he sees and if you are wiseyou will go away without coming any farther but the young man toldher all his sad tale and how he possessed a wonderful snuffbox andhow it had been stolen from him and how he had nothing left now thathe was parted from his wife and was in need of everything and he saidthat perhaps her son who traveled so far might have seen a palacewith laths of gold and tiles of diamond and furnished all in silver andgold as he spoke these last words the moon came in and said hesmelled mortal flesh and blood but his mother told him that it was anunhappy man who had lost everything and had come all this way toconsult him and bade the young man not to be afraid but to comeforward and show himself so he went boldly up to the moon and askedif by any accident he had seen a palace with the laths of gold and thetiles of diamond and all the furniture of silver and gold once thishouse belonged to him but now it was stolen and the moon said nobut that the sun traveled farther than he did and that the young manhad better go and ask himso the young man departed and went away away away as well as hishorse would take him begging his living as he rode along and somehowor other at last he got to the land of the sun there he found alittle old woman who asked him what are you doing here go awayhave you not heard that my son feeds upon christians but he said noand that he would not go for he was so miserable that it was all oneto him whether he died or not that he had lost everything andespecially a splendid palace like none other in the whole world for ithad laths of gold and tiles of diamond and all the furniture was ofsilver and gold and that he had sought it far and long and in all theearth there was no man more unhappy so the old womans heart meltedand she agreed to hide himwhen the sun arrived he declared that he smelled christian flesh and hemeant to have it for his dinner but his mother told him such apitiful story of the miserable wretch who had lost everything and hadcome from far to ask his help that at last he promised to see himso the young man came out from his hidingplace and begged the sun totell him if in the course of his travels he had not seen somewhere apalace that had not its like in the whole world for its laths were ofgold and its tiles of diamond and all the furniture in silver and goldand the sun said no but that perhaps the wind had seen it for heentered everywhere and saw things that no one else ever saw and ifanyone knew where it was it was certainly the windthen the poor young man again set forth as well as his horse could takehim begging his living as he went and somehow or other he ended byreaching the home of the wind he found there a little old womanbusily occupied in filling great barrels with water she asked himwhat had put it into his head to come there for her son ate everythinghe saw and that he would shortly arrive quite mad and that the youngman had better look out but he answered that he was so unhappy thathe had ceased to mind anything even being eaten and then he told herthat he had been robbed of a palace that had not its equal in all theworld and of all that was in it and that he had even left his wifeand was wandering over the world until he found it and that it wasthe sun who had sent him to consult the wind so she hid him under thestaircase and soon they heard the south wind arrive shaking the houseto its foundations thirsty as he was he did not wait to drink buthe told his mother that he smelled the blood of a christian man andthat she had better bring him out at once and make him ready to beeaten but she bade her son eat and drink what was before him andsaid that the poor young man was much to be pitied and that the sunhad granted him his life in order that he might consult the wind thenshe brought out the young man who explained how he was seeking for hispalace and that no man had been able to tell him where it was so hehad come to the wind and he added that he had been shamefully robbedand that the laths were of gold and the tiles of diamond and all thefurniture in silver and gold and he inquired if the wind had not seensuch a palace during his wanderingsand the wind said yes and that all that day he had been blowingbackward and forward over it without being able to move one singletile oh do tell me where it is cried the young man it is along way off replied the wind on the other side of the red seabut our traveler was not discouragedhe had already journeyed too farso he set forth at once and somehow or other he managed to reach thatdistant land and he inquired if any one wanted a gardener he wastold that the head gardener at the castle had just left and perhaps hemight have a chance of getting the place the young man lost no timebut walked up to the castle and asked if they were in want of agardener and how happy he was when they agreed to take him now hepassed most of his day in gossiping with the servants about the wealthof their masters and the wonderful things in the house he madefriends with one of the maids who told him the history of thesnuffbox and he coaxed her to let him see it one evening she managedto get hold of it and the young man watched carefully where she hid itaway in a secret place in the bedchamber of her mistressthe following night when everyone was fast asleep he crept in andtook the snuffbox think of his joy as he opened the lid when itasked him as of yore what do you want he replied what do iwant what do i want why i want to go with my palace to the oldplace and for the king and the queen and all their servants to bedrowned in the red seahe had hardly finished speaking when he found himself back again withhis wife while all the other inhabitants of the palace were lying atthe bottom of the red seathe golden blackbirdby paul sbillotonce upon a time there was a great lord who had three sons he fellvery ill sent for doctors of every

cure the sick manso the old lord dispatched his eldest son to look for the wonderfulbird and promised him great riches if he managed to find it and bringit backthe young man began his journey and soon arrived at a place where fourroads met he did not know which to choose and tossed his cap in theair determining that the direction of its fall should decide himafter traveling for two or three days he grew tired of walking withoutknowing where or for how long and he stopped at an inn which wasfilled with merrymakers and ordered something to eat and drinkmy faith said he it is sheer folly to waste more time hunting forthis bird my father is old and if he dies i shall inherit hisgoodsthe old man after waiting patiently for some time sent his second sonto seek the golden blackbird the youth took the same direction as hisbrother and when he came to the crossroads he too tossed up which roadhe should take the cap fell in the same place as before and hewalked on till he came to the spot where his brother had halted thelatter who was leaning out of the window of the inn called to him tostay where he was and amuse himselfyou are right replied the youth who knows if i should ever findthe golden blackbird even if i sought the whole world through for itat the worst if the old man dies we shall have his propertyhe entered the inn and the two brothers made merry and feasted tillvery soon their money was all spent they even owed something to theirlandlord who kept them as hostages till they could pay their debtsthe youngest son set forth in his turn and he arrived at the placewhere his brothers where still prisoners they called to him to stopand did all they could to prevent his going furtherno he replied my father trusted me and i will go all over theworld till i find the golden blackbirdbah said his brothers you will never succeed any better than wedid let him die if he wants to we will divide the propertyas he went his way he met a little hare who stopped to looked at himand askedwhere are you going my friend i really dont quite know answered he my father is ill and hecannot be cured unless i bring him back the golden blackbird it is along time since i set out but no one can tell me where to find itah said the hare you have a long way to go yet you will have towalk at least seven hundred miles before you get to itand how am i to travel such a distancemount on my back said the little hare and i will conduct youthe young man obeyed at each bound the little hare went seven milesand it was not long before they reached a castle that was as large andbeautiful as a castle could bethe golden blackbird is in a little cabin near by said the littlehare and you will easily find it it lives in a little cage withanother cage beside it made all of gold but whatever you do be surenot to put it in the beautiful cage or everybody in the castle willknow that you have stolen itthe youth found the golden blackbird standing on a wooden perch but asstiff and rigid as if he was dead and beside was the beautiful cagethe cage of goldperhaps he would revive if i were to put him in that lovely cagethought the youththe moment the golden blackbird had touched the bars of the splendidcage he awoke and began to whistle so that all the servants of thecastle ran to see what was the matter saying that he was a thief andmust be put in prisonno he answered i am not a thief if i have taken the goldenblackbird it is only that it may cure my father who is ill and ihave traveled more than seven hundred miles in order to find itwell they replied we will let you go and will even give you thegolden blackbird if you are able to bring us the porcelain maidenthe youth departed weeping and met the little hare who was munchingwild thymewhat are you crying for my friend asked the hareit is because he answered the castle people will not allow me tocarry off the golden blackbird without giving them the porcelain maidenin exchangeyou have not followed my advice said the little hare and you haveput the golden blackbird into the fine cagealas yesdont despair the porcelain maiden is a young girl beautiful asvenus who dwells two hundred miles from here jump on my back and iwill take you therethe little hare who took seven miles in a stride was there in no timeat all and he stopped on the borders of a lakethe porcelain maiden said the hare to the youth will come here tobathe with her friends keep yourself out of sight behind the thicketwhile i just eat a mouthful of thyme to refresh me when she is in thelake be sure you hide her clothes which are of dazzling whiteness anddo not give them back to her unless she consents to follow youthe little hare left him and almost immediately the porcelain maidenarrived with her friends she undressed herself and got into thewater then the young man glided up noiselessly and laid hold of herclothes which he hid under a rock at some distancewhen the porcelain maiden was tired of playing in the water she cameout to dress herself but though she hunted for her clothes high andlow she could find them nowhere her friends helped her in the searchbut seeing at last that it was of no use they left her alone on thebank weeping bitterlywhy do you cry said the young man approaching heralas answered she while i was bathing some one stole my clothesand my friends have abandoned mei will find your clothes if you will only come with meand the porcelain maiden agreed to follow him and after having givenup her clothes the young man bought a small horse for her which wentlike the wind the little hare brought them both back to seek for thegolden blackbird and when they drew near the castle where it lived thelittle hare said to the young mannow do be a little sharper than you were before and you will manageto carry off both the golden blackbird and the porcelain maiden takethe golden cage in one hand and leave the bird in the old cage where heis and bring that away toothe little hare then vanished the youth did as he was bid and thecastle servants never noticed that he was carrying off the goldenblackbird when he reached the inn where his brothers were detained hedelivered them by paying their debt they set out all together but asthe two elder brothers were jealous of the success of the youngestthey took the opportunity as they were passing by the shores of a laketo throw themselves upon him seize the golden blackbird and fling himin the water then they continued their journey taking with them theporcelain maiden in the firm belief that their brother was drownedbut happily he had snatched in falling at a tuft of rushes and calledloudly for help the little hare came running to him and said takehold of my leg and pull yourself out of the waterwhen he was safe on shore the little hare said to himnow this is what you have to do dress yourself like a breton seekinga place as stableboy and go and offer your services to your fatheronce there you will easily be able to make him understand the truththe young man did as the little hare bade him and he went to hisfathers castle and inquired if they were not in want of a stableboyyes replied his father very much indeed but it is not an easyplace there is a little horse in the stable which will not let anyonego near it and it has already kicked to death several people who havetried to groom iti will undertake to groom it said the

weddingfeastthe halfchickretold by andrew langonce upon a time there was a handsome black spanish hen who had a largebrood of chickens they were all fine plump little birds except theyoungest who was quite unlike his brothers and sisters indeed hewas such a strange queerlooking creature that when he first clippedhis shell his mother could scarcely believe her eyes he was sodifferent from the twelve other fluffy downy soft little chicks whonestled under her wings this one looked just as if he had been cut intwo he had only one leg and one wing and one eye and he had half ahead and half a beak his mother shook her head sadly as she looked athim and saidmy youngest born is only a halfchick he can never grow up a tallhandsome cock like his brothers they will go out into the world andrule over poultry yards of their own but this poor little fellow willalways have to stay at home with his mother and she called him mediopollito which is spanish for halfchicknow though medio pollito was such an odd helplesslooking littlething his mother soon found that he was not at all willing to remainunder her wing and protection indeed in character he was as unlikehis brothers and sisters as he was in appearance they were goodobedient chickens and when the old hen chicked after them they chirpedand ran back to her side but medio pollito had a roving spirit inspite of his one leg and when his mother called to him to return tothe coop he pretended that he could not hear because he had only oneearwhen she took the whole family out for a walk in the fields mediopollito would hop away by himself and hide among the corn many ananxious minute his brothers and sisters had looking for him while hismother ran to and fro cackling in fear and dismayas he grew older he became more selfwilled

pollito to this day and if you go to madridand walk through the streets till you come to the highest church youwill see medio pollito perched on his one leg on the steeple with hisone wing drooping at his side and gazing sadly out of his one eye overthe townthe three brothersby hermann r kletkethere was once upon a time a witch who in the shape of a hawk usedevery night to break the windows of a certain village church in thesame village there lived three brothers who were all determined tokill the mischievous hawk but in vain did the two eldest mount guardin the church with their guns as soon as the bird appeared high abovetheir heads sleep overpowered them and they only awoke to hear thewindows crashing inthen the younger brother took his turn of guarding the windows and toprevent his being overcome by sleep he placed a lot of thorns under hischin so that if he felt drowsy and nodded his head they would prickhim and keep him awakethe moon was already risen and it was as light as day when suddenly heheard a fearful noise and at the same time a terrible desire to sleepoverpowered himhis eyelids closed and his head sank on his shoulders but the thornsran into him and were so painful that he awoke at once he saw thehawk swooping down upon the church and in a moment he had seized hisgun and shot at the bird the hawk fell heavily under a big stoneseverely wounded in its right wing the youth ran to look at it andsaw that a huge abyss had opened below the stone he went at once tofetch his brothers and with their help dragged a lot of pine wood andropes to the spot they fastened some of the burning pine wood to theend of the rope and let it slowly down to the bottom of the abyss atfirst it was quite dark and the flaming torch only lit up dirty graystone walls but the youngest brother determined to explore the abyssand letting himself down by the rope he soon reached the bottom herehe found a lovely meadow full of green trees and exquisite flowersin the middle of the meadow stood a huge stone castle with an irongate leading to it which was wide open everything in the castleseemed to be made of copper and the only inhabitant he could discoverwas a lovely girl who was combing her golden hair and he noticed thatwhenever one of her hairs fell on the ground it rang out like puremetal the youth looked at her more closely and saw that her skin wassmooth and fair her blue eyes bright and sparkling and her hair asgolden as the sun he fell in love with her on the spot and kneelingat her feet he implored her to become his wifethe lovely girl accepted his proposal gladly but at the same time shewarned him that she could never come up to the world above till hermother the old witch was dead and she went on to tell him that theonly way in which the old creature could be killed was with the swordthat hung up in the castle but the sword was so heavy that no onecould lift itthen the youth went into a room in the castle where everything was madeof silver and here he found another beautiful girl the sister of hisbride she was combing her silver hair and every hair that fell onthe ground rang out like pure metal the second girl handed him thesword but though he tried with all his strength he could not lift itat last a third sister came to him and gave him a drop of something todrink which she said would give him the needful strength he drankone drop but still he could not lift the sword then he drank a secondand the sword began to move but only after he had drunk a third dropwas he able to swing the sword over his headthen he hid himself in the castle and awaited the old witchs arrivalat last as it was beginning to grow dark she appeared she swoopeddown upon a big apple tree and after shaking some golden apples fromit she pounced down upon the earth as soon as her feet touched theground she became transformed from a hawk into a woman this was themoment the youth was waiting for and he swung his mighty sword in theair with all his strength and the witchs head fell off and her bloodspurted upon the wallswithout fear of any further danger he packed up all the treasures ofthe castle into great chests and gave his brothers a signal to pullthem up out of the abyss first the treasures were attached to therope and then the three lovely girls and now everything was up aboveand only he himself remained below but as he was a little suspiciousof his brothers he fastened a heavy stone on to the rope and let thempull it up at first they heaved with a will but when the stone washalfway up they let it drop suddenly and it fell to the bottom brokeninto a hundred piecesso thats what would have happened to my bones had i trusted myself tothem said the youth sadly and he cried bitterly not because of thetreasures but because of the lovely girl with her swanlike neck andgolden hairfor a long time he wandered sadly all through the beautiful underworldand one day he met a magician who asked him the cause of his tearsthe youth told him all that had befallen him and the magician saiddo not grieve young man if you will guard the children who arehidden in the golden apple tree i will bring you at once up to theearth another magician who lives in this land always eats my childrenup it is in vain that i have hidden them under the earth and lockedthem into the castle now i have hidden them in the apple tree hideyourself there too and at midnight you will see my enemythe youth climbed up the tree and picked some of the beautiful goldenapples which he ate for his supper at midnight the wind began torise and a rustling sound was heard at the foot of the tree the youthlooked down and beheld a long thick serpent beginning to crawl up thetree it wound itself round the stem and gradually got higher andhigher it stretched its huge head in which the eyes glitteredfiercely among the branches searching for the nest in which thelittle children lay they trembled with terror when they saw thehideous creature and hid themselves beneath the leavesthen the youth swung his mighty sword in the air and with one blow cutoff the serpents head he cut up the rest of the body into littlebits and strewed them to the four windsthe father of the rescued children was so delighted over the death ofhis enemy that he told the youth to get on his back and thus hecarried him up to the world abovewith what joy did he hurry now to his brothers house he burst into aroom where they were all assembled but no one knew who he was onlyhis bride who was serving as cook to her sisters recognized her loverat oncehis brothers who had quite believed he was dead yielded him up histreasures at once and flew into the woods in terror but the goodyouth forgave them all they had done and divided his treasures withthem then he built himself a big castle with golden windows andthere he lived happily with his goldenhaired wife till the end oftheir livesthe glass mountainby hermann r kletkeonce upon a time there was a glass mountain at the top of which stood acastle made of pure gold and in front of the castle there grew anapple tree on which there were golden applesanyone who picked an apple gained admittance into the golden castleand there in a silver room sat an enchanted princess of surpassingfairness and beauty she was as rich too as she was beautiful forthe cellars of the castle were full of precious stones and greatchests of the finest gold stood round the walls of all the roomsmany knights had come from afar to try their luck but it was in vainthey attempted to climb the mountain in spite of having their horsesshod with sharp nails no one managed to get more than halfway up andthen they all fell back right down to the bottom of the steep slipperyhill sometimes they broke an arm sometimes a leg and many a braveman had broken his neck eventhe beautiful princess sat at her window and watched the bold knightstrying to reach her on their splendid horses the sight of her alwaysgave men fresh courage and they flocked from the four quarters of theglobe to attempt the work of rescuing her but all in vain and forseven years the princess had sat now and waited for some one to scalethe glass mountaina heap of corpses both of riders and horses lay round the mountain andmany dying men lay groaning there unable to go any further with theirwounded limbs the whole neighborhood had the appearance of a vastchurchyard in three more days the seven years would be at an endwhen a knight in golden armor and mounted on a spirited steed was seenmaking his way toward the fatal hillsticking his spurs into his horse he made a rush at the mountain andgot up halfway then he calmly turned his horses head and came downagain without a slip or stumble the following day he started in thesame way the horse trod on the glass as if it had been level earthand sparks of fire flew from its hoofs all the other knights gazed inastonishment for he had almost gained the summit and in anothermoment he would have reached the apple tree but of a sudden a hugeeagle rose up and spread its mighty wings hitting as it did so theknights horse in the eye the beast shied opened its wide nostrilsand tossed its mane then rearing high up in the air its hind feetslipped and it fell with its rider down the steep mountain sidenothing was left of either of them except their bones which rattled inthe battered golden armor like dry peas in a podand now there was only one more day before the close of the sevenyears then there arrived on the scene a mere school boya merryhappyhearted youth but at the same time strong and well grown hesaw how many knights had broken their necks in vain but undaunted heapproached the steep mountain on foot and began the ascentfor long he had heard his parents speak of the beautiful princess whosat in the golden castle at the top of the glass mountain he listenedto all he heard and determined that he too would try his luck butfirst he went to the forest and caught a lynx and cutting off thecreatures sharp claws he fastened them on to his own hands and feetarmed with these weapons he boldly started up the glass mountain thesun was nearly going down and the youth had not got more than halfwayup he could hardly draw breath he was so worn out and his mouth wasparched by thirst a huge black cloud passed over his head but invain did he beg and beseech her to let a drop of water fall on him heopened his mouth but the black cloud sailed past and not as much as adrop of dew moistened his dry lipshis feet were torn and bleeding and he could only hold on now with hishands evening closed in and he strained his eyes to see if he couldbehold the top of the mountain then he gazed beneath him and what asight met his eyes a yawning abyss with certain and terrible deathat the bottom reeking with halfdecayed bodies of horses and ridersand this had been the end of all the other brave men who like himselfhad attempted the ascentit was almost pitch dark now and only the stars lit up the glassmountain the poor boy still clung on as if glued to the glass by hisbloodstained hands he made no struggle to get higher for all hisstrength had left him and seeing no hope he calmly awaited deaththen all of a sudden he fell into a deep sleep and forgetful of hisdangerous position he slumbered sweetly but all the same although heslept he had stuck his sharp claws so firmly into the glass that hewas quite safe not to fallnow the golden apple tree was guarded by the eagle which hadoverthrown the golden knight and his horse every night it flew roundthe glass mountain keeping a careful lookout and no sooner had themoon emerged from the clouds than the bird rose up from the apple treeand circling round in the air caught sight of the sleeping youthgreedy for carrion and sure that this must be a fresh corpse the birdswooped down upon the boy but he was awake now and perceiving theeagle he determined by its help to save himselfthe eagle dug its sharp claws into the tender flesh of the youth buthe bore the pain without a sound and seized the birds two feet withhis hands the creature in terror lifted him high up into the air andbegan to circle round the tower of the castle the youth held onbravely he saw the glittering palace which by the pale rays of themoon looked like a dim lamp and he saw the high windows and round oneof them a balcony in which the beautiful princess sat lost in sadthoughts then the boy saw that he was close to the apple tree anddrawing a small knife from his belt he cut off both the eagles feetthe bird rose up in the air in its agony and vanished into the cloudsand the youth fell on to the broad branches of the apple treethen he drew out the claws of the eagles feet that had remained in hisflesh and put the peel of one of the golden apples on the wound and inone moment it was healed and well again he pulled several of thebeautiful apples and put them in his pocket then he entered thecastle the door was guarded by a great dragon but as soon as hethrew an apple at it the beast vanishedat the same moment a gate opened and the youth perceived a courtyardfull of flowers and beautiful trees and on a balcony sat the lovelyenchanted princess with her retinueas soon as she saw the youth she ran toward him and greeted him as herhusband and master she gave him all her treasures and the youthbecame a rich and mighty ruler but he never returned to the earthfor only the mighty eagle who had been the guardian of the princessand of the castle could have carried on his wings the enormoustreasure down to the world but as the eagle had lost its feet itdied and its body was found in a wood on the glass mountainone day when the youth was strolling about the palace garden with theprincess his wife he looked down over the edge of the glass mountainand saw to his astonishment a great number of people gathered therehe blew his silver whistle and the swallow who acted as messenger inthe golden castle flew pastfly down and ask what the matter is he said to the little bird whosped off like lightning and soon returned sayingthe blood of the eagle has restored all the people below to life allthose who have perished on this mountain are awakening up today as itwere from a sleep and are mounting their horses and the wholepopulation are gazing on this unheardof wonder with joy andamazementhuntsman the unluckyby john t

whose name was trojan this emperor hadgoats ears and he used to call in barber after barber to shave himbut whoever went in never came out again for while the barber wasshaving him the emperor would ask what he observed uncommon in himand when the barber would answer that he observed his goats ears theemperor would immediately cut him into piecesat last it came to the turn of a certain barber to go who feignedillness and sent his apprentice instead when the apprentice appearedbefore the emperor he was asked why his master did not come and heanswered because he is ill then the emperor sat down and allowedthe youth to shave himas he shaved him the apprentice noticed the emperors goats ears butwhen trojan asked him what he had observed he answered i haveobserved nothingthen the emperor gave him twelve ducats and said to himfrom this time forth you shall always come and shave mewhen the apprentice came home his master asked him how he got on atthe emperors and the youth answeredall well and the emperor has told me that i am to shave him infuturethen he showed the twelve ducats he had received but as to theemperors goats ears of that he said nothingfrom this time forth the apprentice went regularly to trojan to shavehim and for each shaving he received twelve ducats but he told no onethat the emperor had goats earsat last it began to worry and torment him that he dare tell no one hissecret and he became sick and began to pine away his master whocould not fail to observe this asked him what ailed him and aftermuch pressing the apprentice confessed that he had something on hisheart which he dared not confide to anyone and he added if i couldonly tell it to somebody i should feel better at oncethen said the mastertell it to me and i will faithfully keep it from everybody else orif you fear to trust me with it then go to the confessor and confideit to him but if you will not do even that then go into the fieldsoutside the town there dig a hole thrust your head into it and tellthe earth three times what you know then throw the mold in again andfill up the holethe apprentice chose the last course went into the field outside thecity dug a hole into which he thrust his head and called out threetimesthe emperor trojan has goats earsthen he filled up the hole again and with his mind quite relieved wenthomewhen some time had passed by there sprang an elder tree out of thisvery hole and three slender sterns grew up beautiful and straight astapers some shepherds found this elder cut off one of the stems andmade a pipe of it but as soon as they began to blow into the newpipe out burst the wordsthe emperor trojan has goats earsthe news of this strange occurrence spread immediately through thewhole city and at last the emperor trojan himself heard the childrenblowing on a pipethe emperor trojan has goats earshe sent instantly for the barbers apprentice and shouted to himheh what is this you have been telling the people about methe poor youth began at once to explain that he had indeed noticed theemperors ears but had never told a soul of it the emperor tore hissaber out of its sheath to hew the apprentice down at which the youthwas so frightened that he told the whole story in its order how he hadconfessed himself to the earth how an elder tree had sprang up on thevery spot and how when a pipe was made of one of its sterns the talewas sounded in every directionthen the emperor took the apprentice with him in a carriage to theplace to convince himself of the truth of the story and when theyarrived there they found there was only a single stem left theemperor trojan ordered a pipe to be made out of this stem that hemight hear how it sounded as soon as the pipe was ready and one ofthem blew into it out poured the wordsthe emperor trojan has goats earsthen the emperor was convinced that nothing on this earth could behidden spared the barber apprentices life and henceforth allowed anybarber without exception to come and
